<p class="ph2">PREFACE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the series of books on American history,
upon which I have for many years been engaged,
the present volumes come between "The Discovery
of America" and "The Beginnings of New
England." The opening chapter, with its brief
sketch of the work done by Elizabeth's great sailors,
takes up the narrative where the concluding
chapter of "The Discovery of America" dropped
it. Then the story of Virginia, starting with Sir
Walter Raleigh and Rev. Richard Hakluyt, is
pursued until the year 1753, when the youthful
George Washington sets forth upon his expedition
to warn the approaching Frenchmen from any further
encroachment upon English soil. That moment
marks the arrival of a new era, when a book
like the present&mdash;which is not a local history nor
a bundle of local histories&mdash;can no longer follow
the career of Virginia, nor of the southern colonies,
except as part and parcel of the career of the
American people. That "continental state of
things," which was distinctly heralded when the
war of the Spanish Succession broke out during
Nicholson's rule in Virginia, had arrived in 1753.
To treat it properly requires preliminary consideration
of many points in the history of the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>ern
colonies, and it is accordingly reserved for a
future work.</p>

<p>It will be observed that I do not call the present
work a "History of the Southern Colonies." Its
contents would not justify such a title, inasmuch
as its scope and purpose are different from what
such a title would imply. My aim is to follow
the main stream of causation from the time of
Raleigh to the time of Dinwiddie, from its sources
down to its absorption into a mightier stream.
At first our attention is fixed upon Raleigh's Virginia,
which extends from Florida to Canada, England
thrusting herself in between Spain and France.
With the charter of 1609 (see below, vol. i. p.
145) Virginia is practically severed from North
Virginia, which presently takes on the names of
New England and New Netherland, and receives
colonies of Puritans and Dutchmen, with which
this book is not concerned.</p>

<p>From the territory of Virginia thus cut down,
further slices are carved from time to time; first
Maryland in 1632, then Carolina in 1663, then
Georgia in 1732, almost at the end of our narrative.
Colonies thus arise which present a few or
many different social aspects from those of Old
Virginia; and while our attention is still centred
upon the original commonwealth as both historically
most important and in personal detail most
interesting, at the same time the younger common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>wealths
claim a share in the story. A comparative
survey of the social features in which North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Maryland differed
from one another, and from Virginia, is a great
help to the right understanding of all four commonwealths.
To Maryland I find that I have
given 107 pages, while the Carolinas, whose history
begins practically a half century later, receive
67 pages; a mere mention of the beginnings of
Georgia is all that suits the perspective of the present
story. The further development of these
southern communities will, it is hoped, receive attention
in a later work.</p>

<p>As to the colonies founded in what was once
known as North Virginia, I have sketched a portion
of the story in "The Beginnings of New
England," ending with the accession of William
and Mary. The remainder of it will form the
subject of my next work, already in preparation,
entitled "The Dutch and Quaker Colonies in
America;" which will comprise a sketch of the
early history of New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
and Pennsylvania, with a discussion of the
contributions to American life which may be traced
to the Dutch, German, Protestant French, and
Scotch-Irish migrations previous to the War of
Independence.</p>

<p>To complete the picture of the early times and to
"make connections" with "The American Revo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>lution,"
still another work will be needed, which
shall resume the story of New England at the accession
of William and Mary. With that story the
romantic fortunes of New France are inseparably
implicated, and in the course of its development
one colony after another is brought in until from
the country of the Wabenaki to that of the Cherokees
the whole of English America is involved in
the mightiest and most fateful military struggle
which the eighteenth century witnessed. The
end of that conflict finds thirteen colonies nearly
ripe for independence and union.</p>

<p>The present work was begun in 1882, and its
topics have been treated in several courses of lectures
at the Washington University in St. Louis,
and elsewhere. In 1895 I gave a course of twelve
such lectures, especially prepared for the occasion,
at the Lowell Institute in Boston. But the book
cannot properly be said to be "based upon" lectures;
the book was primary and the lectures secondary.</p>

<p>The amount of time spent in giving lectures and
in writing a schoolbook of American history has
greatly delayed the appearance of this book. It
is more than five years since "The Discovery of
America" was published; I hope that "The Dutch
and Quaker Colonies" will appear after a much
shorter interval.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="c">THE SEA KINGS.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tercentenary of the Discovery of America, 1792.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> one thinks of the resounding chorus of
gratulations with which the four hundredth anniversary
of the Discovery of America was lately
heralded to a listening world, it is curious and
instructive to notice the sort of comment which
that great event called forth upon the occasion of
its third centenary, while the independence of the
United States was as yet a novel and ill-appreciated
fact. In America very little fuss was made. Railroads
were as yet unknown, and the era of world's
fairs had not begun. Of local celebrations there
were two; one held in New York, the other in
Boston; and as in 1892, so in 1792, New
York followed the Old Style date, the
twelfth of October, while Boston undertook
to correct the date for New Style.
This work was discreditably bungled, however, and
the twenty-third of October was selected instead
of the true date, the twenty-first. In New York
the affair was conducted by the newly founded political
society named for the Delaware chieftain Tammany,
in Boston by the Massachusetts Historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Society, whose founder, Dr. Jeremy Belknap, delivered
a thoughtful and scholarly address upon the
occasion. Both commemorations of the day were
very quiet and modest.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Abbé Raynal.</div>

<p>In Europe little heed was paid to America and
its discovery, except in France, which, after taking
part in our Revolutionary War, was at length
embarking upon its own Revolution, so different
in its character and fortunes. Without knowing
much about America, the Frenchmen of that day
were fond of using it to point a moral and adorn
a tale. In 1770 the famous Abbé Raynal
had published his "Philosophical
and Political History of the Establishments and
Commerce of the Europeans in the Two Indies,"
a book in ten volumes, which for a time enjoyed
immense popularity. Probably not less than one
third of it was written by Diderot, and more than
a dozen other writers contributed to its pages,
while the abbé, in editing these various chapters
and adding more from his own hand, showed himself
blissfully ignorant of the need for any such
thing as critical judgment in writing history. In
an indescribably airy and superficial manner the
narrative flits over the whole vast field of the intercourse
of Europeans with the outlying parts of
the earth discovered since the days of Columbus
and Gama; and at length, in the last chapter of
the last volume, we are confronted with the question,
What is all this worth? Our author answers
confidently, Nothing! worse than nothing! the
world would have been much better off if America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
had never been discovered and the ocean route to
Asia had remained unknown!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was the discovery of America a blessing or a curse to mankind?</div>

<div class="sidenote">Abbé Genty.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Quinine.</div>

<p>This opinion seems to have been a favourite
hobby with the worthy Raynal; for in 1787, in
view of the approaching tercentenary, we find him
proposing to the Academy of Lyons the offer of a
prize of fifty louis for the best essay upon the
question whether the discovery of America
had been a blessing or a curse to
mankind. It was furthermore suggested
that the essay should discuss the most
practicable methods of increasing the benefits and
diminishing the ills that had flowed and continued
to flow from that memorable event. The announcement
of the question aroused considerable
interest, and a few essays were written, but the
prize seems never to have been awarded. One of
these essays was by the Marquis de Chastellux,
who had served in America as major-general in the
army of Count Rochambeau. The accomplished
author maintains, chiefly on economic grounds,
that the discovery has been beneficial to mankind;
in one place, mindful of the triumph of the American
cause in the grand march upon Yorktown
wherein he had himself taken part, he exclaims,
"O land of Washington and Franklin, of Hancock
and Adams, who could ever wish thee non-existent
for them and for us?" To this Baron Grimm<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
replied, "Perhaps he will wish it who reflects
that the independence of the United States has
cost France nearly two thousand million francs,
and is hastening in Europe a revolutionary outbreak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>which had better be postponed or averted."
To most of these philosophers no doubt Chastellux
seemed far too much of an optimist, and the writer
who best expressed their sentiments was
the Abbé Genty, who published at Orleans,
in 1787, an elaborate essay, in two tiny volumes,
entitled "The Influence of the Discovery of
America upon the Happiness of the Human Race."
Genty has no difficulty in reaching the conclusion
that the influence has been chiefly for the bad.
Think what a slaughter there had been of innocent
and high-minded red men by brutal and ruthless
whites! for the real horrors described by Las
Casas were viewed a century ago in the light of
Rousseau's droll notions as to the exalted virtues
of the noble savage. Think, too, how most of the
great European wars since the Peace of Westphalia
had grown out of quarrels about colonial empire!
Clearly Columbus had come with a sword,
not with an olive branch, and had but opened a
new chapter in the long Iliad of human woe.
Against such undeniable evils, what benefits could
be alleged except the extension of commerce, and
that, says Genty, means merely the multiplication
of human wants, which is not in itself a thing to
be desired.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> One unqualified benefit, however,
Genty and all the other writers freely admit;
the introduction of quinine into Europe
and its use in averting fevers. That
item of therapeutics is the one cheery note in the
mournful chorus of disparagement, so long as our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
attention is confined to the past. In the future,
perhaps, better things might be hoped for. Along
the Atlantic coast of North America a narrow
fringe of English-speaking colonies had lately
established their political independence and succeeded
in setting on foot a federal government
under the presidency of George Washington. The
success of this enterprise might put a new face
upon things and ultimately show that after all the
discovery of the New World was a blessing to
mankind.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> So says the Abbé Genty in his curious
little book, which even to-day is well worth
reading.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish and English America.</div>

<p>If now, after the lapse of another century, we
pause to ask the question why the world was so
much more interested in the Western hemisphere
in 1892 than in 1792, we may fairly say that it
is because of the constructive work, political and
social, that has been done here in the interval by
men who speak English. Surely, if there were
nothing to show but the sort of work in colonization
and nation-making that characterized
Spanish America under its Old Régime,
there would be small reason for
celebrating the completion of another century of
such performance. During the present century,
indeed, various parts of Spanish America have
begun to take on a fresh political and social life,
so that in the future much may be hoped for
them. But the ideas and methods which have
guided this revival have been largely the ideas
and methods of English-speaking people, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
imperfectly conceived and reproduced. The whole
story of this western hemisphere since Genty wrote
gives added point to his opinion that its value to
mankind would be determined chiefly by what the
people of the United States were likely to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Precious metals.</div>

<p>The smile with which one regards the world-historic
importance accorded to the discovery of
quinine is an index of the feeling that there are
broad ways and narrow ways of dealing with such
questions. To one looking through a glass of
small calibre a great historical problem may resolve
itself into a question of food and drugs.
Your anti-tobacco fanatic might contend that civilized
men would have been much better off had
they never become acquainted with the Indian
weed. An economist might more reasonably point
to potatoes and maize&mdash;to say nothing of many
other products peculiar to the New World&mdash;as an
acquisition of which the value can hardly be overestimated.
To reckon the importance of a new
piece of territory from a survey of its material
productions is of course the first and most natural
method. The Spanish conquerors valued America
for its supply of precious metals and set
little store by other things in comparison.
But for the discovery of gold mines in 1496
the Spanish colony founded by Columbus in Hispaniola
would probably have been abandoned.
That was but the first step in the finding of gold
and silver in enormous quantities, and thenceforth
for a long time the Spanish crown regarded its
transatlantic territories as an inexhaustible mine
of wealth. But the value of money to mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
depends upon the uses to which it is put; and here
it is worth our while to notice the chief use to
which Spain applied her American treasure during
the sixteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aims of Columbus.</div>

<p>The relief of the church from threatening dangers
was in those days the noblest and most sacred
function of wealth. When Columbus
aimed his prow westward from the Canaries,
in quest of the treasures of Asia, its precious
stones, its silk-stuffs, its rich shawls and rugs, its
corals and dye-woods, its aromatic spices, he expected
to acquire vast wealth for the sovereigns
who employed him and no mean fortune for
himself. In all negotiations he insisted upon a
good round percentage, and could no more be induced
to budge from his price than the old Roman
Sibyl with her books. Of petty self-seeking and
avarice there was probably no more in this than in
commercial transactions generally. The wealth
thus sought by Columbus was not so much an end
as a means. His spirit was that of a Crusader,
and his aim was not to discover a New World (an
idea which seems never once to have entered his
head), but to acquire the means for driving the
Turk from Europe and setting free the Holy
Sepulchre. Had he been told upon his melancholy
death-bed that instead of finding a quick
route to Cathay he had only discovered a New
World, it would probably have added fresh bitterness
to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spain and the Protestant revolt.</div>

<p>But if this lofty and ill-understood enthusiast
failed in his search for the treasures of Cathay, it
was at all events not long before Cortes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Pizarro succeeded in finding the treasures of
Mexico and Peru, and the crusading scheme of
Columbus descended as a kind of legacy to the
successors of Ferdinand and Isabella, the magnanimous
but sometimes misguided Charles, the
sombre and terrible Philip. It remained a crusading
scheme, but, no longer patterned after that of
Godfrey and Tancred, it imitated the mad folly
which had once extinguished in southern Gaul the
most promising civilization of its age. Instead
of a Spanish crusade which might have expelled
the most worthless and dangerous of barbarians
from eastern Europe, it became a Spanish crusade
against everything in the shape of political and
religious freedom, whether at home or
abroad. The year in which Spanish
eyes first beheld the carved serpents on
Central American temples was the year in which
Martin Luther nailed his defiance to the church
door at Wittenberg. From the outworn crust of
mediævalism the modern spirit of individual freedom
and individual responsibility was emerging,
and for ninety years all Europe was rent with the
convulsions that ensued. In the doubtful struggle
Spain engaged herself further and further, until
by 1570 she had begun to sacrifice to it all her
energies. Whence did Philip II. get the sinews
of war with which he supported Alva and Farnese,
and built the Armada called Invincible? Largely
from America, partly also from the East Indies,
since Portugal and her colonies were seized by
Philip in 1580. Thus were the first-fruits of the
heroic age of discovery, both to east and to west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of Borgia's meridian, devoted to the service of the
church with a vengeance, as one might say, a lurid
vengeance withal and ruthless. By the year 1609,
when Spain sullenly retired, baffled and browbeaten,
from the Dutch Netherlands, she had
taken from America more gold and silver than
would to-day be represented by five thousand million
dollars, and most of this huge treasure she
had employed in maintaining the gibbet for political
reformers and the stake for heretics. In view of
this grewsome fact, Mr. Charles Francis Adams
has lately asked the question whether the discovery
of America was not, after all, for at least a
century, fraught with more evil than benefit to
mankind. One certainly cannot help wondering
what might have been the immediate result had
such an immense revenue been at the disposal of
William and Elizabeth rather than Philip.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nations are made wealthy, not by inflation but by production.</div>

<p>Such questions are after all not so simple as
they may seem. It is not altogether clear that
such a reversal of the conditions from the start
would have been of unmixed benefit to
the English and Dutch. After the five
thousand millions had been scattered to
the winds, altering the purchasing power
of money in all directions, it was Spain that was
impoverished while her adversaries were growing
rich and strong. A century of such unproductive
expenditure went far toward completing the industrial
ruin of Spain, already begun in the last
Moorish wars, and afterward consummated by the
expulsion of the Moriscos. The Spanish discovery
of America abundantly illustrates the truths that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
gold were to become as plentiful as iron it would
be worth much less than iron, and that it is not
inflation but production that makes a nation
wealthy. In so far as the discovery of America
turned men's minds from steady industry to gold-hunting,
it was a dangerous source of weakness
to Spain; and it was probably just as well for
England that the work of Cortes and Pizarro was
not done for her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deepest significance of the discovery of America.</div>

<p>But the great historic fact, most conspicuous
among the consequences of the discovery of
America, is the fact that colonial empire, for England
and for Holland, grew directly out of the
long war in which Spain used American and East
Indian treasure with which to subdue the English
and Dutch peoples and to suppress the principles
of civil and religious liberty which they represented.
The Dutch tore away from Spain the
best part of her East Indian empire, and the glorious
Elizabethan sea kings, who began the work of
crippling Philip II. in America, led the
way directly to the English colonization
of Virginia. Thus we are introduced to
the most important aspect of the discovery
of America. It opened up a fresh soil, enormous
in extent and capacity, for the possession of
which the lower and higher types of European
civilization and social polity were to struggle. In
this new arena the maritime peoples of western
Europe fought for supremacy; and the conquest
of so vast a field has given to the ideas of the victorious
people, and to their type of social polity,
an unprecedented opportunity for growth and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>velopment.
Sundry sturdy European ideas, transplanted
into this western soil, have triumphed
over all competitors and thriven so mightily as to
react upon all parts of the Old World, some more,
some less, and thus to modify the whole course of
civilization. This is the deepest significance of
the discovery of America; and a due appreciation
of it gives to our history from its earliest stages
an epic grandeur, as the successive situations
unfold themselves and events with unmistakable
emphasis record their moral. In the conflict of
Titans that absorbed the energies of the sixteenth
century, the question whether it should be the
world of Calderon or the world of Shakespeare
that was to gain indefinite power of future expansion
was a question of incalculable importance
to mankind.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the history of English-speaking
America are thus to be sought in the history
of the antagonism between Spain and England
that grew out of the circumstances of the Protestant
Reformation. It was as the storehouse of the
enemy's treasure and the chief source of his supplies
that America first excited real interest among
the English people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyages of the Cabots.</div>

<p>English ships had indeed crossed the Atlantic
many years before this warfare broke out. The
example set by Columbus had been promptly followed
by John Cabot and his young son Sebastian,
in the two memorable voyages of 1497
and 1498, but the interest aroused by
those voyages was very short-lived. In later days
it suited the convenience of England to cite them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in support of her claim to priority in the discovery
of the continent of North America; but many
years elapsed before the existence of any such
continent was distinctly known and before England
cared to put forth any such claim. All that
contemporaries could see was that the Cabots had
sailed westward in search of the boundless treasures
of Cathay, and had come home empty-handed
without finding any of the cities described by
Marco Polo or meeting any civilized men. So
little work was found for Sebastian Cabot that he
passed into the service of Spain, and turned his
attention to voyages in the South Atlantic. Such
scanty record was kept of the voyages of 1497
and 1498 that we cannot surely tell what land the
Cabots first saw; whether it was the bleak coast
of northern Labrador or some point as far south
as Cape Breton is still a matter of dispute. The
case was almost the same as with the voyage of
Pinzon and Vespucius, whose ships were off Cape
Honduras within a day or two after Cabot's northern
landfall, and who, after a sojourn at Tampico,
passed between Cuba and Florida at the end of
April, 1498. In the one case, as in the other,
the expeditions sank into obscurity because they
found no gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Newfoundland fisheries.</div>

<p>The triumphant return of Gama from Hindustan,
in the summer of 1499, turned all men's eyes
to southern routes, and little heed was paid to the
wild inhospitable shores visited by John Cabot
and his son. The sole exception to the general
neglect was the case of the fisheries on the banks
of Newfoundland. From the beginning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>sixteenth century European vessels came almost
yearly to catch fish there, but at first
Englishmen took little or no part in
this, for they had long been wont to get
their fish in the waters about Iceland, and it took
them some years to make the change. On the
bright August day of 1527 when Master John Rut
sailed into the bay of St. John, in Newfoundland,
he found two Portuguese, one Breton, and eleven
Norman ships fishing there. Basques also came
frequently to the spot. Down to that time it is
not likely that the thought of the western shores
of the Atlantic entered the heads of Englishmen
more frequently than the thought of the Antarctic
continent, discovered sixty years ago, enters the
heads of men in Boston to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earliest English references to America.</div>

<p>The lack of general interest in maritime discovery
is shown by the fact that down to 1576, so
far as we can make out, only twelve books upon
the subject had been published in England, and
these were in great part translations of works
published in other countries. The earliest indisputable
occurrence of the name America
in any printed English document is in
a play called "A new interlude and a
mery of the nature of the iiii elements," which was
probably published in 1519.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> About the same
time there appeared from an Antwerp press a
small book entitled "Of the newe landes and of
y<sup>e</sup> people found by the messengers of the Kynge
of Portugal;" in it occurs the name <i>Armenica</i>,
which is probably a misprint for America, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the account of it is evidently taken from the
account which Vespucius gives of the natives of
Brazil, and in its earliest use the name America
was practically equivalent to Brazil. With the
exception of a dim allusion to Columbus in Sebastian
Brandt's "Ship of Fools," these are the only
references to the New World that have been found
in English literature previous to 1553.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Muscovy Company.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Richard Eden.</div>

<p>The youthful Edward VI., who died that year,
had succeeded in recalling Sebastian Cabot from
Spain, and under the leadership of that navigator
was formed the joint-stock company quaintly entitled,
"The Mysterie and Companie of the Merchant
Adventurers for the Discoverie of Regions,
Dominions, Islands, and Places unknown." It was
the first of that series of sagacious and
daring combinations of capital of which
the East India Company has been the
most famous. It was afterwards more briefly
known as the Muscovy Company. Under its auspices,
on the 21st of May, 1553, an English fleet of
exploration, under Sir Hugh Willoughby, set sail
down the Thames while the cheers of thronging
citizens were borne through the windows of the
palace at Greenwich to the ears of the sick young
king. The ill-fated expedition, seeking a northeasterly
passage to Cathay, was wrecked on the coast
of Lapland, and only one of the ships got home, but
the interest in maritime adventure grew rapidly.
A few days before Edward's death, Richard Eden
published his "Treatyse of the Newe India,"
which was largely devoted to the discoveries in
America. Two years later, in 1555, Eden fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>lowed
this by his "Decades of the Newe World,"
in great part a version of Peter Martyr's Latin.
This delightful book for the first time made the
English people acquainted with the results
of maritime discovery in all quarters
since the great voyage of 1492. It enjoyed a
wide popularity; poets and dramatists of the next
generation read it in their boyhood and found
their horizon wondrously enlarged. In its pages
doubtless Shakespeare found the name of that
Patagonian deity Setebos, which Caliban twice lets
fall from his grotesque lips. Three years after
Eden's second book saw the light the long reign
of Queen Elizabeth began, and with it the antagonism,
destined year by year to wax more violent
and deadly, between England and Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Hawkins and the African slave-trade.</div>

<p>Meanwhile English mariners had already taken
a hand in the African slave-trade, which since
1442 had been monopolized by the Portuguese. It
is always difficult to say with entire confidence
just who first began anything, but William Hawkins,
an enterprising merchant of Plymouth,
made a voyage on the Guinea coast
as early as 1530, or earlier, and carried
away a few slaves. It was his son, the famous
Captain John Hawkins, who became the real
founder of the English trade in slaves. In this
capacity Americans have little reason to remember
his name with pleasure, yet it would be a grave
mistake to visit him with unmeasured condemnation.
Few sturdier defenders of political freedom
for white men have ever existed, and among the
valiant sea kings who laid the foundations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
England's maritime empire he was one of the
foremost. It is worthy of notice that Queen Elizabeth
regarded the opening of the slave-trade as
an achievement worthy of honourable commemoration,
for when she made Hawkins a knight she
gave him for a crest the device of a negro's head
and bust with the arms tightly pinioned, or, in the
language of heraldry, "a demi-Moor proper bound
with a cord." Public opinion on the subject of
slavery was neatly expressed by Captain Lok,
who declared that the negroes were "a people of
beastly living, without God, law, religion, or commonwealth,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
so that he deemed himself their benefactor
in carrying them off to a Christian land
where their bodies might be decently clothed and
their souls made fit for heaven. Exactly three
centuries after Captain Lok, in the decade preceding
our Civil War, I used to hear the very same
defence of slavery preached in a Connecticut pulpit;
so that perhaps we are not entitled to frown
too severely upon Elizabeth's mariners. It takes
men a weary while to learn the wickedness of anything
that puts gold in their purses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hawkins and Laudonnière.</div>

<p>It was in 1562 that John Hawkins made his first
famous expedition to the coast of Guinea, where he
took three hundred slaves and carried them over
to San Domingo. It was illicit traffic, of course,
but the Spanish planters and miners were too
much in need of cheap labour to scrutinize too
jealously the source from which it was offered.
The Englishman found no difficulty in selling his
negroes, and sailed for home with his three ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>loaded with sugar and ginger, hides and pearls.
The profits were large, and in 1564 the experiment
was repeated with still greater success. On the
way home, early in August, 1565, Hawkins stopped
at the mouth of the St. John's River in Florida,
and found there a woebegone company
of starving Frenchmen. They were the
party of René de Laudonnière, awaiting
the return of their chief commander, Jean Ribaut,
from France. Their presence on that shore was
the first feeble expression of the master thought
that in due course of time originated the United
States of America, and the author of that master
thought was the great Admiral Coligny. The
Huguenot wars had lately broken out in France,
but already that far-sighted statesman had seen the
commercial and military advantages to be gained
by founding a Protestant state in America. After
an unsuccessful attempt upon the coast of Brazil,
he had sent Jean Ribaut to Florida, and the little
colony was now suffering the frightful hardships
that were the lot of most new-comers into the
American wilderness. Hawkins treated these poor
Frenchmen with great kindness, and his visit with
them was pleasant. He has left an interesting
account of the communal house of the Indians in
the neighbourhood, an immense barn-like frame
house, with stanchions and rafters of untrimmed
logs, and a roof thatched with palmetto leaves.
Hawkins liked the flavour of Indian meal, and in
his descriptions of the ways of cooking it one easily
recognizes both "hasty pudding" and hoe-cake.
He thought it would have been more prudent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the Frenchmen if they had raised corn for themselves
instead of stealing it from the Indians and
arousing a dangerous hostility. For liquid refreshment
they had been thrown upon their own resources,
and had contrived to make a thousand
gallons or more of claret from the native grapes of
the country. A letter of John Winthrop reminds
us that the Puritan settlers of Boston in their first
summer also made wine of wild grapes,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and according
to Adam of Bremen the same thing was done
by the Northmen in Vinland in the eleventh century,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
showing that in one age and clime as well as
in another thirst is the mother of invention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Massacre of Huguenots: the painter Le Moine.</div>

<p>As the Frenchmen were on the verge of despair,
Hawkins left them one of his ships in which to
return to France, but he had scarcely departed
when the long expected Ribaut arrived with reinforcements,
and soon after him came that terrible
Spaniard, Menendez, who butchered the whole
company, men, women, and children,
about 700 Huguenots in all. Some half
dozen escaped and were lucky enough
to get picked up by a friendly ship and carried to
England. Among them was the painter Le Moine,
who became a friend of Sir Philip Sidney, and
aroused much interest with his drawings of American
beasts, birds, trees, and flowers. The story
of the massacre awakened fierce indignation. Hostility
to Spain was rapidly increasing in England,
and the idea of Coligny began to be entertained
by a few sagacious heads. If France could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
plant a Protestant state in America, perhaps England
could. A little later we find Le Moine consulted
by the gifted half-brothers, Humphrey
Gilbert and Walter Raleigh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Francis Drake.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The affair of San Juan de Ulua.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1567, the gallant Hawkins went
on an eventful voyage, with five stout ships, one
of which was commanded by a very capable and
well educated young man, afterwards and until
Nelson's time celebrated as the greatest
of English seamen. Francis Drake was
a native of Devonshire, son of a poor clergyman
who had been molested for holding Protestant
opinions. The young sea king had already gathered
experience in the West Indies and on the
Spanish Main; this notable voyage taught him the
same kind of feeling toward Spaniards that Hannibal
cherished toward Romans. After the usual
traffic among the islands the little squadron was
driven by stress of weather to seek shelter in the
port of San Juan de Ulua, at the present site of
Vera Cruz. There was no force there fit to resist
Hawkins, and it is droll to find that pious hero,
such a man of psalms and prayers, pluming himself
upon his virtue in not seizing some Spanish
ships in the harbour laden with what we should
call five million dollars' worth of silver. The next
day a fleet of thirteen ships from Spain
arrived upon the scene. Hawkins could
perhaps have kept them from entering
the harbour, but he shrank from the responsibility
of bringing on a battle in time of peace; the queen
might disapprove of it. So Hawkins parleyed
with the Spaniards, a solemn covenant of mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
forbearance was made and sworn to, and he let
them into the harbour. But the orthodox Catholic
of those days sometimes entertained peculiar views
about keeping faith with heretics. Had not his
Holiness Alexander VI. given all this New World
to Spain? Poachers must be warned off; the
Huguenots had learned a lesson in Florida, and
it was now the Englishmen's turn. So Hawkins
was treacherously attacked, and after a desperate
combat, in which fireships were used, three of his
vessels were destroyed. The other two got out to
sea, but with so scanty a larder that the crews
were soon glad to eat cats and dogs, rats and mice,
and boiled parrots. It became necessary to set
114 men ashore somewhere to the north of Tampico.
Some of these men took northeasterly trails,
and mostly perished in the woods, but David
Ingram and two companions actually made their
way across the continent and after eleven months
were picked up on the coast of Nova Scotia by a
friendly French vessel and taken back to Europe.
About seventy, led by Anthony Goddard, less prudently
marched toward the city of Mexico, and
fell into the clutches of the Inquisition; three were
burned at the stake and all the rest were cruelly
flogged and sent to the galleys for life. When
the news of this affair reached England a squadron
of Spanish treasure-ships, chased into the Channel
by Huguenot cruisers, had just sought refuge in
English harbours, and the queen detained them in
reprisal for the injury done to Hawkins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growing hostility to Spain in England.</div>

<p>News had lately arrived of the bloody vengeance
wreaked by Dominique de Gourgues upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Spaniards in Florida, while the cruelties of Alva
were fast goading the Netherlands into rebellion.
Next year, 1570, on a fresh May morning, the
Papal Bull "declaring Elizabeth deposed and her
subjects absolved from their allegiance was found
nailed against the Bishop of London's door,"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
when the rash young gentleman who had
put it there was discovered he was taken
back to that doorstep and quartered
alive. Two years later came the Paris Matins on
the day of St. Bartholomew, and the English ambassador
openly gave shelter to Huguenots in his
house. Elizabeth's policy leaned more and more
decidedly toward defiance of the Catholic powers
until it culminated in alliance with the revolted
Netherlands in January, 1578. Meanwhile the
interest in America quickly increased. Those were
the years when Martin Frobisher made his glorious
voyages in the Arctic Ocean, soon to be followed
by John Davis. Almost yearly Drake crossed the
Atlantic and more than once attacked and ravaged
the Spanish settlements in revenge for the treachery
at San Juan de Ulua. Books and pamphlets
about America began to come somewhat frequently
from the press.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Size and strength of Elizabeth's England.</div>

<div class="sidenote">How the sea became England's field of war.</div>

<p>It is worth our while here to pause for a moment
and remark upon the size and strength of the
nation that was so soon to contend successfully
for the mastery of the sea.
There is something so dazzling in the
brilliancy of the age of Queen Bess, it is so
crowded with romantic incidents, it fills so large a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>place in our minds, that we hardly realize how
small England then was according to modern
standards of measurement. Two centuries earlier,
in the reign of Edward III., the population of
England had reached about 5,000,000, when the
Black Death at one fell swoop destroyed at least
half the number. In Elizabeth's time the loss
had just about been repaired. Her England was
therefore slightly less populous, and it was surely
far less wealthy, than either New York or Pennsylvania
in 1890. The Dutch Netherlands had
perhaps somewhat fewer people than England, but
surpassed her in wealth. These two allies were
pitted against the greatest military power that had
existed in Europe since the days of Constantine
the Great. To many the struggle seemed hopeless.
For England the true policy was limited by
circumstances. She could send troops across the
Channel to help the Dutch in their stubborn resistance,
but to try to land a force in the Spanish
peninsula for aggressive warfare would be sheer
madness. The shores of America and the open
sea were the proper field of war for England.
Her task was to paralyze the giant
by cutting off his supplies, and in this
there was hope of success, for no defensive fleet,
however large, could watch all Philip's enormous
possessions at once. The English navy, first permanently
organized under Henry VIII., grew
rapidly in Elizabeth's reign under the direction of
her incomparable seamen; and the policy she
adopted was crowned with such success that Philip
II. lived to see his treasury bankrupt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Loose ideas of international law.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bold advice to Elizabeth.</div>

<p>This policy was gradually adopted soon after
the fight at San Juan de Ulua, and long before
there was any declaration of war. The extreme
laxness of that age, in respect of international
law, made it possible for such things to go on to
an extent that now seems scarcely comprehensible.
The wholesale massacre of
Frenchmen in Florida, for example, occurred
at a time of profound peace between France
and Spain, and reprisal was made, not by the
French government but by a private gentleman
who had to sell his ancestral estate to raise the
money. It quite suited Elizabeth's tortuous policy,
in contending against formidable odds, to be able
either to assume or to disclaim responsibility for
the deeds of her captains. Those brave men well
understood the situation, and with earnest patriotism
and chivalrous loyalty not only accepted it,
but even urged the queen to be allowed to serve
her interests at their own risk. In a letter handed
to her in November, 1577, the writer begs to be
allowed to destroy all Spanish ships caught fishing
on the banks of Newfoundland, and adds, "If you
will let us first do this we will next take
the West Indies from Spain. You will
have the gold and silver mines and the profit of
the soil. You will be monarch of the seas and out
of danger from every one. I will do it if you will
allow me; only you must resolve and not delay or
dally&mdash;the wings of man's life are plumed with
the feathers of death."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The signature to this
bold letter has been obliterated, but it sounds like
Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and is believed to be his.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The sea kings were not buccaneers.</div>

<p>In connection with this it should be remembered
that neither in England nor elsewhere at that time
had the navy become fully a national affair as at
present. It was to a considerable extent supported
by private speculation, and as occasion required a
commercial voyage or a voyage of discovery might
be suddenly transformed into a naval campaign.
A flavour of buccaneering pervades nearly all the
maritime operations of that age and often
leads modern writers to misunderstand or
misjudge them. Thus it sometimes happens
that so excellent a man as Sir Francis Drake,
whose fame is forever a priceless possession for
English-speaking people, is mentioned in popular
books as a mere corsair, a kind of gentleman
pirate. Nothing could show a more hopeless confusion
of ideas. In a later generation the warfare
characteristic of the Elizabethan age degenerated
into piracy, and when Spain, fallen from
her greatness, became a prey to the spoiler, a
swarm of buccaneers infested the West Indies
and added another hideous chapter to the lurid
history of those beautiful islands. They were
mere robbers, and had nothing in common with
the Elizabethan heroes except courage. From the
deeds of Drake and Hawkins to the deeds of
Henry Morgan, the moral distance is as great as
from slaying your antagonist in battle to murdering
your neighbour for his purse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why Drake carried the war into the Pacific Ocean.</div>

<p>It was Drake who first put into practice the
policy of weakening Philip II. by attacking him in
America. It served the direct purpose of destroying
the sinews of war, and indirectly it neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>ized
for Europe some of Spain's naval strength by
diverting it into American waters for self-defence.
To do such work most effectively it seemed desirable
to carry the warfare into the Pacific
Ocean. The circumstances of its discovery
had made Spanish America almost
more of a Pacific than an Atlantic power.
The discoverers happened to approach the great
double continent where it is narrowest, and the
hunt for precious metals soon drew them to the
Cordilleras and their western slopes. The mountain
region, with its untold treasures of gold and
silver, from New Mexico to Bolivia, became theirs.
In acquiring it they simply stepped into the place
of the aboriginal conquering tribes, and carried on
their work of conquest to completion. The new
rulers conducted the government by their own
Spanish methods, and the white race was superposed
upon a more or less dense native population.
There was no sort of likeness to colonies planted
by England, but there were some points of resemblance
to the position of the English in recent
times as a ruling race in Hindustan. Such was
the kind of empire which Spain had founded in
America. Its position, chiefly upon the Pacific
coast, rendered it secure against English conquest,
though not against occasional damaging attacks.
In South America, where it reached back in one or
two remote points to the Atlantic coast, the chief
purpose was to protect the approach to the silver
mines of Bolivia by the open route of the river
La Plata. It was this military need that was met
by the growth of Buenos Ayres and the settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ments
in Paraguay, guarding the entrance and the
lower reaches of the great silver river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drake upon a peak in Darien.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of the Golden Hind.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A noble banquet room.</div>

<p>Soon after the affair of San Juan de Ulua, Drake
conceived the idea of striking at this Spanish domain
upon its unguarded Pacific side. In
1573, after marching across the isthmus
of Darien, the English mariner stood
upon a mountain peak, not far from where Balboa
sixty years before had stood and looked down
upon the waste of waters stretching away to shores
unvisited and under stars unknown. And as he
looked, says Camden, "vehemently transported
with desire to navigate that sea, he fell upon his
knees and implored the divine assistance that he
might at some time sail thither and make a perfect
discovery of the same." On the 15th of November,
1577, Drake set sail from Plymouth, on this
hardy enterprise, with five good ships. It was a
curious coincidence that in the following July and
August, while wintering on the Patagonia coast
at Port St. Julian, Drake should have discovered
symptoms of conspiracy and felt obliged to behead
one of his officers, as had been the case with
Magellan at the same place. By the time he had
passed the straits in his flagship, the Golden
Hind,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he had quite lost sight of his consorts, who
had deserted him in that watery labyrinth,
as Gomez had stolen away from Magellan.
For men of common mould a voyage
in the remote South Sea still had its terrors; but
the dauntless captain kept on with his single ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of twenty guns, and from Valparaiso northward
along the Peruvian coast dashed into seaports and
captured vessels, carrying away enormous treasures
in gold and silver and jewels, besides such
provisions as were needed for his crew. With
other property he meddled but little, and no acts
of wanton cruelty sullied his performances. After
taking plunder worth millions of dollars, this corsair-work
gave place to scientific discovery, and
the Golden Hind sailed far northward in search
of a northeast passage into the Atlantic. Drake
visited a noble bay, which may have been that of
San Francisco, and sailed some distance along that
coast, which he called New Albion. It is probable,
though not quite certain, that he saw some
portion of the coast of Oregon. Not finding any
signs of a northeast passage, he turned his prow
westward, crossed the Pacific, and returned home
by way of the Cape of Good Hope, arriving at
Plymouth in September, 1580. Some time afterward
he went up the Thames to Deptford, where
the queen came to dinner on board the Golden
Hind, and knighted on his own quarter-deck the
bold captain who had first carried the English flag
around the world. The enthusiastic chronicler Holinshed
wished that in memory of this grand achievement
the ship should be set upon the top of St.
Paul's Cathedral, "that being discerned farre and
neere, it might be noted and pointed at of people
with these true termes: Yonder is the barke that
hath sailed round about the world."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> A different
career awaited the sturdy Golden Hind; for many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>a year she was kept at Deptford, a worthy object
of popular admiration, and her cabin
was made into a banquet room wherein
young and old might partake of the mutton and
ale of merry England; until at last, when the
venerable ship herself had succumbed to the tooth
of Time, a capacious chair was carved from her
timbers and presented to the University of Oxford,
where it may still be seen in the Bodleian Library.
In it sat Abraham Cowley when he wrote the

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Gilbert and Raleigh.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Shipwreck of Gilbert.</div>

<p>Meanwhile in the autumn of 1578, while the
coasts of Chili were echoing the roar of the
Golden Hind's cannon, a squadron of seven ships
sailed from England, with intent to found a permanent
colony on the Atlantic coast of North
America. Its captain was one of the
most eminent of Devonshire worthies,
Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and one of the
ships was commanded by his half-brother, Walter
Raleigh, a young man of six-and-twenty who had
lately returned from volunteer service in the Netherlands.
The destination of the voyage was "Norumbega,"
which may have meant any place between
the Hudson and Penobscot rivers, but was
conceived with supreme vagueness, as may be seen
from Michael Lok's map of 1582.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>fleet had at least one savage fight with Spaniards,
and returned to Plymouth without accomplishing
anything. In 1583 Gilbert sought a favourable
place for settlement on the southern coast of Newfoundland,
probably with a view to driving the
Spaniards away from the fishing grounds, but an
ill fate overtook him. On the American coast his
principal vessel crushed its bows against a sunken
rock and nearly all hands were lost. With two
small ships the captain soon set sail for home, but
his own tiny craft foundered in a terrible
storm near Fayal. As she sank, Gilbert
cheerily shouted over the tafferel to his consort,
"The way to heaven is as near by sea as by
land," a speech, says his chronicler, "well beseeming
a soldier resolute in Jesus Christ, as I can
testify he was."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gilbert's patent granted to Raleigh.</div>

<p>It was not Raleigh's fault that he did not share
the fate of his revered half-brother, for the queen's
mind had been full of forebodings and she had
refused to let him go on the voyage. It was since
the former disastrous expedition that Raleigh had
so quickly risen in favour at court; that he had
thrown down his velvet cloak as a mat for Elizabeth's
feet and had written on a window-pane the
well-known verse which that royal coquette so cleverly
capped. He became Captain of the Queen's
Guard and Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and
was presented with the confiscated estates of traitors
in England and Ireland. In 1584,
when his late half-brother's patent for
land in America expired, it was renewed
in Raleigh's name. On March 25th was sealed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
document that empowered him to "hold by homage
remote heathen and barbarous lands, not actually
possessed by any Christian prince, nor inhabited
by Christian people, which he might discover
within the next six years."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> As had been the
custom with Spanish and Portuguese grants to
explorers, one fifth of the gold and silver to be
obtained was to be reserved for the crown. The
heathen and barbarous land which Raleigh had in
view was the Atlantic coast of North America so
far as he might succeed in occupying it. He knew
that Spain claimed it all as her own by virtue of
the bull of Pope Alexander VI., but Elizabeth had
already declared in 1581 that she cared nothing
for papal bulls and would recognize no Spanish
claims to America save such as were based upon
discovery followed by actual possession.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Raleigh's
attention had long been turned toward Florida.
In youth he had served in France under Coligny,
and had opportunities for hearing that statesman's
plan for founding a Protestant state in America
discussed. We have seen Le Moine, the French
artist who escaped from the Florida massacre, consorting
with Raleigh and with Sir Philip Sidney.
Upon those men fell the mantle of Coligny, and
the people of the United States may well be proud
to point to such noble figures standing upon the
threshold of our history.</p>

<p>One provision in the Gilbert patent, now renewed
for Raleigh, is worth especial mention. It
was agreed that the English colonies which should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>be planted in America "should have all the privileges
of free denizens and persons native of England,
in such ample manner as if they were born
and personally resident in our said realm of England,"
and that any law to the contrary should be
of no effect; furthermore, that the people
of those colonies should be governed
by such statutes as they might choose to
establish for themselves, provided that such statutes
"conform as near as conveniently may be
with those of England, and do not oppugn the
Christian faith, or anyway withdraw the people
of those lands from our allegiance." A more
unequivocal acknowledgment of the rights of self-government
which a British government of two
centuries later saw fit to ignore, it would be hard
to find. Gilbert and Raleigh demanded and
Elizabeth granted in principle just what Patrick
Henry and Samuel Adams demanded and George
III. refused to concede.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Amidas and Barlow, 1584.</div>

<p>The wealthy Raleigh could act promptly, and
before five weeks had elapsed two ships, commanded
by Philip Amidas and Arthur
Barlow, had started on a reconnoitring
voyage. On the 4th of July, 1584, they
reached the country now known as North Carolina,
at some point not far from Cape Lookout.
Thence a northerly run of over a hundred miles
brought them to the New Inlet, through which
they passed into Pamlico Sound and visited Roanoke
Island. They admired the noble pine-trees
and red cedars, marvelled at the abundance of
game, and found the native barbarians polite and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
friendly. Their attempt to learn the name of the
country resulted as not uncommonly in such first
parleys between strange tongues. The Indian of
whom the question was asked had no idea what
was meant and uttered at random the Ollendorfian
reply, "Win-gan-da-coa," which signified, "What
pretty clothes you wear!" So when Amidas and
Barlow returned to England they said they had
visited a country by the name of Wingandacoa;
but the queen, with a touch of the euphuism then
so fashionable, suggested that it should be called,
in honour of herself, Virginia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ralph Lane's expedition, 1585.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rescue of Lane by Sir Francis "the Dragon."</div>

<p>In the spring of 1585 Raleigh, who had lately
been knighted, sent out a hundred or more men
commanded by Ralph Lane, to make the beginnings
of a settlement. They were convoyed by
Raleigh's cousin, Sir Richard Grenville,
with seven well-armed ships. They entered
Pamlico Sound through Ocracoke
Inlet, and trouble with the natives at once began.
One of the Indians stole a silver cup, and Grenville
unwisely retaliated by setting fire to their
standing corn. Having thus sown the seeds of
calamity he set the colonists ashore upon Roanoke
Island and went on his way. The sagacious and
energetic Lane explored the neighbouring mainland
for many miles along the coast and for some
distance into the interior, and even tried to find a
waterway into the Pacific Ocean. He made up
his mind that the country was not favourable for a
new colony, and he gathered sundry bits of information
which seemed to point to Chesapeake Bay
as a much better place. The angry Indians made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
much trouble, and after a year had passed the
colonists were suffering from scarcity of food,
when all at once Sir Francis Drake appeared on
the scene with a superb fleet of three-and-twenty
ships. War between Spain and England had
been declared in July, 1585, when Sidney and
Drake were about ready to execute a scheme that
contemplated the founding of an American colony
by Sidney. But the queen interfered and sent
Sidney to the Netherlands, where he was so soon
to die a noble death. The terrible Drake, whom
Spaniards, punning upon his name, had begun to
call "Dragon," gave them fresh cause to dread
and revile him. He had captured 20
ships with 250 cannon, he had taken and
sacked Cartagena, St. Domingo, and St.
Augustine, and on his way home looked
in at Roanoke Island, in time to take Lane and his
starving party on board and carry them back to
England. They had not long been gone when
Grenville arrived with supplies, and was astonished
at finding the island deserted. Knowing nothing
of Lane's change of purpose, and believing that
his party must still be somewhere in the adjacent
country, Grenville left a guard of fifteen men
on the island, with ample supplies, and sailed
away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cavendish's voyage around the world, 1586-88.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Drake "singes the beard" of Philip II.</div>

<p>The stirring days of the Armada were approaching.
When Lane arrived in England, his services
were needed there, and after a while we find him a
member of the Council of War. One of this first
American colonizing party was the wonderful Suffolk
boy, Thomas Cavendish, aged two-and-twenty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>who had no sooner landed in England than he set
sail in command of three ships, made his way into
the Pacific Ocean, and repeated the exploits of
Drake from Chili to California, captured
one of Spain's finest galleons, and then in
two years more completed the circumnavigation
of the globe. While the pupil
was thus nobly acquitting himself, the master in
the spring of 1587 outdid all former achievements.
Sailing into the harbour of Cadiz, Drake defeated
the warships on guard there, calmly loaded his
own vessels with as much Spanish spoil as could
safely be carried, then set fire to the storeships
and cut their cables. More than a hundred transports,
some of them 1,500 tons in burthen, all
laden with stores for the Armada, became a tangled
and drifting mass of blazing ruin,
while amid the thunder of exploding
magazines the victor went forth on his
way unscathed and rejoicing. Day after day he
crouched under the beetling crags of Cintra, catching
and sinking every craft that passed that lair,
then swept like a tempest into the bay of Coruña
and wrought similar havoc to that of Cadiz, then
stood off for the Azores and captured the great
carrack on its way from the Indies with treasure
reckoned by millions. Europe stood dumb with
amazement. What manner of man was it that
could thus "singe the King of Spain's beard"?
"Philip one day invited a lady of the court to join
him in his barge on the Lake of Segovia. The
lady said she dared not trust herself on the water,
even with his Majesty," for fear of Sir Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Drake.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Philip's Armada had to wait for another
year, while by night and day the music of adze and
hammer was heard in English shipyards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White's colony on Roanoke Island, 1587.</div>

<p>Just as "the Dragon" returned to England
another party of Raleigh's colonists was approaching
the American coast. There were about 150,
including 17 women. John White, a man deft
with water-colours, who had been the artist of
Lane's expedition, was their governor. Their settlement
was to be made on the shore of
Chesapeake Bay, but first they must stop
at Roanoke Island and pick up the fifteen
men left on watch by Grenville. Through some
carelessness or misunderstanding or bad faith on
the part of the convoy, the people once landed
were left in the lurch with only one small vessel,
and thus were obliged to stay on that fatal Roanoke
Island. They soon found that Grenville's
little guard had been massacred by red men. It
was under these gloomy circumstances that the
first child of English parents was born on the soil
of the United States. The governor's daughter
Eleanor was wife of Ananias Dare, and their little
girl, born August 18, 1587, was named Virginia.
Before she was ten days old her grandfather found
it necessary to take the ship and return to England
for help.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Invincible Armada, 1588.</div>

<p>But the day of judgment for Spain and England
was at hand, and lesser things must wait.
Amid the turmoil of military preparation, Sir
Walter was not unmindful of his little colony.
Twice he fitted out relief expeditions, but the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>was stopped because all the ships were seized for
government service, and the second was driven
back into port by Spanish cruisers. While the
anxious governor waited through the lengthening
days into the summer of 1588, there came,
with its imperious haste, its deadly agony
and fury, its world-astounding triumph,
the event most tremendous, perhaps, that mankind
have witnessed since the star of the Wise Men
stood over the stable at Bethlehem. Then you might
have seen the sea kings working in good fellowship
together,&mdash;Drake and Hawkins, Winter and Frobisher,
with Howard of Effingham in the Channel
fleet; Raleigh and Grenville active alike in council
and afield; the two great ministers, Burghley and
Walsingham, ever crafty and vigilant; and in the
background on her white palfrey the eccentric
figure of the strangely wayward and wilful but
always brave and patriotic Queen. Even after
three centuries it is with bated breath that we
watch those 130 black hulks coming up the Channel,
with 3,000 cannon and 30,000 men on board,
among them ninety executioners withal, equipped
with racks and thumbscrews, to inaugurate on
English soil the accursed work of the Inquisition.
In camp at Dunkirk the greatest general of the
age, Alexander Farnese, with 35,000 veterans is
crouching for a spring, like a still greater general
at Boulogne in later days; and one wonders if
the 80,000 raw militia slowly mustering in the
busy little towns and green hamlets of England
can withstand these well-trained warriors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of the Invincible Armada.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Cadiz, 1596.</div>

<p>In the English fleet there were about as many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>ships as the enemy had, much smaller in size and
inferior in weight of metal, but at the same time
far more nimble in movement. Of cannon and
men the English had scarcely half as many as the
Spaniards, but this disparity was more than offset
by one great advantage. Our forefathers had
already begun to display the inventive ingenuity
for which their descendants in both hemispheres
have since become preëminent. Many of their
ships were armed with new guns, of longer range
than any hitherto known, and this advantage,
combined with their greater nimbleness, made it
possible in many cases to pound a Spanish ship to
pieces without receiving any serious hurt
in return. In such respects, as well as
in the seamanship by which the two fleets
were handled, it was modern intelligence pitted
against mediæval chivalry. Such captains as served
Elizabeth were not reared under the blighting
shadow of the Escurial. With the discomfiture of
the Invincible Armada before Dunkirk, the army
of Farnese at once became useless for invading
England. Then came the awful discovery that the
mighty fleet was penned up in the German Ocean,
for Drake held the Strait of Dover in his iron
grip. The horrors of the long retreat through
northern seas have never been equalled save when
Napoleon's hosts were shattered in Russia. In
the disparity of losses, as in the immensity of the
issues at stake, we are reminded of the Greeks
and Persians at Salamis; of Spaniards more than
20,000 perished, but scarcely 100 Englishmen.
The frightful loss of ships and guns announced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
overthrow of Spanish supremacy, but the bitter
end was yet to come. During the next three years
the activity of the sea kings reached such a pitch
that more than 800 Spanish ships were destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The final blow came soon after the deaths
of Drake and Hawkins in 1596, when
Raleigh, with the Earl of Essex and Lord Thomas
Howard, destroyed the Spanish fleet in that great
battle before Cadiz whereof Raleigh wrote that
"if any man had a desire to see Hell itself, it was
there most lively figured."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mystery of the fate of White's colony.</div>

<p>It was not until March, 1591, that Governor
White succeeded in getting to sea again for the
rescue of his family and friends. He had to go
as passenger in a West Indiaman. When he
landed, upon the return voyage, at Roanoke
Island, it was just in time to have celebrated his
little grandchild's fourth birthday. It had been
agreed that should the colonists leave that spot
they should carve upon a tree the name of the
place to which they were going, and if they
should add to the name a cross it would
be understood as a signal of distress.
When White arrived he found grass
growing in the deserted blockhouse. Under the
cedars hard by five chests had been buried, and
somebody had afterwards dug them up and rifled
them. Fragments of his own books and pictures
lay scattered about. On a great tree was cut in
big letters, but without any cross, the word
<span class="smcap">Croatan</span>, which was the name of a neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
island. The captain of the ship was at first willing
to take White to Croatan, but a fierce storm overtook
him and after beating about for some days he
insisted upon making for England in spite of the
poor man's entreaties. No more did White ever
hear of his loved ones. Sixteen years afterward
the settlers at Jamestown were told by Indians
that the white people abandoned at Roanoke had
mingled with the natives and lived with them for
some years on amicable terms until at the instigation
of certain medicine-men (who probably
accused them of witchcraft) they had all been
murdered, except four men, two boys, and a young
woman, who were spared by request or order of a
chief. Whether this young woman was Virginia
Dare, the first American girl, we have no means
of knowing.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Significance of the defeat of the Armada.</div>

<p>Nothing could better illustrate than the pathetic
fate of this little colony how necessary it was to
destroy the naval power of Spain before
England could occupy the soil of North
America. The defeat of the Invincible
Armada was the opening event in the history of
the United States. It was the event that made all
the rest possible. Without it the attempts at
Jamestown and Plymouth could hardly have had
more success than the attempt at Roanoke Island.
An infant colony is like an army at the end of a
long line of communications; it perishes if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
line is cut. Before England could plant thriving
states in America she must control the ocean
routes. The far-sighted Raleigh understood the
conditions of the problem. When he smote the
Spaniards at Cadiz he knew it was a blow struck
for America. He felt the full significance of the
defeat of the Armada, and in spite of all his disappointments
with Virginia, he never lost heart.
In 1602 he wrote to Sir Robert Cecil, "I shall yet
live to see it an English nation."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="c">A DISCOURSE OF WESTERN PLANTING.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Sixteenth century maps.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> all the history of human knowledge there is
no more fascinating chapter than that which deals
with the gradual expansion of men's geographical
ideas consequent upon the great voyages of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is not a tale
so written that he who runs may read it, but its
events have rather to be slowly deciphered from
hundreds of quaint old maps, whereon islands and
continents, mountains and rivers, are delineated
with very slight resemblance to what we now know
to be the reality; where, for instance,
Gog and Magog show a strong tendency
to get mixed up with Memphremagog,
where the capital of China stands a few hundred
miles north of the city of Mexico, and your eye
falls upon a river which you feel sure is the St. Lawrence
until you learn that it is meant for the
Yang-tse-Kiang. In the sixteenth century scarcely
any intellectual stimulus could be found more potent
than the sight of such maps, revealing unknown
lands, or cities and rivers with strange
names, places of which many marvels had been
recounted and almost anything might be believed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard Hakluyt.</div>

<p>One afternoon in the year 1568, the lawyer
Richard Hakluyt was sitting at his desk in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Middle Temple, with a number of such maps and
sundry new books of cosmography spread out
before him, when the door opened and his young
cousin and namesake, then a boy of sixteen studying
at Westminster School, came into the room.
The elder Richard opened the Bible at the 107th
Psalm, and pointed to the verses which declare
that "they which go downe to the sea in ships and
occupy by the great waters, they see the works of
the Lord and his wonders in the deep;" then he
called the lad's attention to the maps, in which he
soon became absorbed. This incident determined
the career of the younger Richard Hakluyt,
and led to his playing an important
part in the beginnings of the United States of
America. A learned and sagacious writer upon
American history, Mr. Doyle, of All Souls College,
Oxford, has truly said that it is "hard to
estimate at its full value the debt which succeeding
generations owe to Richard Hakluyt."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In 1570
he became a student at Christ Church, Oxford,
and took his master's degree in 1577. His book
called "Divers Voyages," dedicated to Sir Philip
Sidney, was published in 1582. From 1583 to
1588 he was chaplain of the English legation at
Paris, and before his return he was appointed
canon of Bristol, an office which he held till 1605.
Thus for many years he lived in the city of the
Cabots, the cradle of the new era of maritime adventure.
He came to be recognized as one of the
foremost geographers of the age and the greatest
living English authority on matters relating to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
New World. The year following the defeat of the
Armada witnessed the publication of his book entitled
"Principal Voyages," which Froude well calls
"the prose epic of the modern English nation."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
In 1605 he was made a prebendary of Westminster,
and eleven years later was buried with distinguished
honours beneath the pavement of the great
Abbey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adventures of a manuscript.</div>

<p>The book of Hakluyt's which here most nearly
concerns us is the "Discourse of Western Planting,"
written in 1584, shortly before the return of
the ships of Amidas and Barlow from Roanoke
Island. It was not published, nor was immediate
publication its aim. It was intended to influence
the mind of Queen Elizabeth. The manuscript
was handed to her about September, 1584, and
after a while was lost sight of until after a long
period of oblivion it turned up in the
library of Sir Peter Thomson, an indefatigable
collector of literary treasures,
who died in 1770. It was bought from his family
by Lord Valentia, after whose death it passed into
the hands of the famous bibliophile Henry Stevens,
who sold it to Sir Thomas Phillips for his vast
collection of archives at Thirlestane House, Cheltenham.
In 1869 a copy of it was made for Dr.
Leonard Woods, President of Bowdoin College, by
whom it was ably edited for the Maine Historical
Society; and at length, in 1877, after a sleep of
nearly three centuries, it was printed at our New
England Cambridge, at the University Press, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
published with valuable notes by the late Dr.
Charles Deane.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons for planting English colonies in America.</div>

<div class="sidenote">English trade with the Netherlands.</div>

<p>Hakluyt wrote this document at the request of
Raleigh, who wished to persuade the queen to invest
money in a colonizing expedition to the New
World. Such an enterprise, he felt, was too great
for any individual purse and needed support from
government. No one had studied the subject so
thoroughly as Hakluyt, and so Raleigh enlisted his
services. In twenty-one brief chapters Hakluyt
sets forth the various reasons why England should
plant colonies on the coast of North America. The
chief reasons are that such colonies will
enlarge the occasions and facilities for
driving Spanish ships from the Newfoundland
fisheries and capturing Spanish
treasure on its way from Mexico and the isthmus
of Darien; they will be serviceable as stations
toward the discovery and use of the northwest passage
to Cathay; after a while they will furnish
a valuable market for the products of English industry,
especially woollen and linen cloths; they
will increase the royal revenue by customs duties;
they will afford new material for the growth of
the navy; and in various ways they will relieve
England of its idlers and vagrants by finding occupation
for them abroad. In his terse quaint way,
the writer emphasizes these points. As for the
Spanish king, "if you touche him in the Indies
you touche the apple of his eye; for take away his
treasure, which is <i>nervus belli</i>, and which he hath
almoste [all] out of his West Indies, his olde
bandes of souldiers will soone be dissolved, his pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>poses
defeated, ... his pride abated, and his
tyranie utterly suppressed." "He shall be left
bare as Æsop's proude crowe." With regard to
creating a new market he says: "Nowe if her
Majestie take these westerne discoveries in hande,
and plant there, yt is like that in short time wee
shall vente as greate a masse of clothe yn those
partes as ever wee did in the Netherlandes, and in
tyme moche more." In this connection he gives a
striking illustration of the closeness of the commercial
ties which had been knit between England and
the Low Countries in the course of the long alliance
with the House of Burgundy. In 1550, when
Charles V. proposed to introduce the Spanish Inquisition
into the Netherlands, it was objected
that all English merchants would then quit the
country, and the English trade would be
grievously diminished. At this suggestion,
"search was made what profite
there came and comoditie grewe by the haunte of
the Englishe marchantes. Then it was founde by
searche and enquirie, that within the towne of Antwerpe
alone there were 14,000 persons fedde and
mayneteyned onlye by the workinge of English
commodities, besides the gaines that marchantes
and shippers with other in the said towne did gett,
which was the greatest part of their lyvinge, which
were thoughte to be in nomber halfe as many
more; and in all other places of his Netherlandes
by the indraping of Englishe woll into clothe, and
by the working of other Englishe comodities, there
were 30,000 persons more mayneteyned and fedd;
which in all amounteth to the nomber of 51,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
persons." When this report was given to Charles
V. it led him to pause and consider, as well it
might.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An American market.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The change from tillage to pasturage.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of pauperism.</div>

<p>According to Hakluyt an English colony in
America would soon afford as good a market for
English labour as the Netherlands. He
was impressed with the belief that the
population of England was fast outrunning its
means of subsistence. Now if the surplus of population
could be drawn to America it would find
occupation in raising the products of that new soil
to exchange for commodities from England, and
this exchange in its turn would increase the demand
for English commodities and for the labour
which produced them, so that fewer people in
England would be left without employment. Such
is Hakluyt's idea, though he nowhere states it
quite so formally. It is interesting because there
is no doubt that he was not alone in holding such
views. There was in many quarters a feeling that,
with its population of about 5,000,000, England
was getting to be over-peopled. This was probably
because for some time past the supply of food and
the supply of work had both been diminishing
relatively to the number of people. For more
than a century the wool trade had been waxing so
profitable that great tracts of land which had formerly
been subject to tillage were year by year
turned into pastures for sheep. This
process not only tended to raise the price
of food, but it deprived many people of
employment, since sheep-farming requires fewer
hands than tilling the soil. Since the accession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Henry VIII. there had been many legislative
attempts to check the conversion of ploughed
land into grassy fields, but the change still continued
to go on.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The enormous increase in the
quantity of precious metals had still further raised
the price of food, while as people were thrown out
of employment the labour market tended to become
overstocked so that wages did not rise. These
changes bore with especial severity upon the class
of peasants. The condition of the freeholding
yeomanry was much improved during the sixteenth
century. Stone houses with floors had taken the
place of rude cabins with rushes carpeting the
ground; meat was oftener eaten, clothes were o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>f
better quality. But it was otherwise with the
peasants who held by servile tenures. In the
abolition of mediæval serfdom which had been
going on for two centuries and was completed in
England so much earlier than in any other part of
Europe, it was not all gain for the lowest grades
of labourers. Some through energy and good fortune
rose to recruit the ranks of freeholders, but
many others became paupers and thieves. The
change from tillage to pasturage affected this class
more than any other, for it turned many out of
house and home; so that, in the words of an old
writer, they "prowled about as idle beggars or
continued as stark thieves till the gallows did eat
them."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The sudden destruction of the monasteries
by Henry VIII. deprived the pauper of such
scanty support as he had been wont to get from
the vast wealth of the Church, and besides it had
let loose upon society a vast number of persons
with their old occupations gone and set aside.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In
Elizabeth's reign, therefore, for the various reasons
here mentioned, the growth of pauperism
began to attract especial attention as a
lamentable if not formidable evil, and the famous
"poor law" of 1601 marks a kind of era in the
social history of England. Under such circumstances,
for men disheartened by poverty and
demoralized by idleness, struggling for life in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
community that had ceased to need the kind of
labour they could perform, the best chance of salvation
seemed to lie in emigration to a new colony
where the demand for labour was sure to be
great, and life might be in a measure begun anew.
So thought the good Hakluyt, and the history of
the seventeenth century did much to justify his
opinion. The prodigious development of the English
commercial and naval marine, to which the
intercourse with the new and thriving American
colonies greatly contributed, went far toward
multiplying the opportunities for employment and
diminishing the numbers of the needy and idle
class. Many of the sons of the men who had been
driven from their farms by sheep-raising landlords
made their home upon the ocean, and helped to
secure England's control of the watery pathways.
Many of them found new homes in America, and
as independent yeomen became more thrifty than
their peasant fathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition to Hakluyt.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The queen's penuriousness.</div>

<p>While there were many people who espoused
Hakluyt's views, while preachers might be heard
proclaiming from the pulpit that "Virginia was a
door which God had opened for England," on the
other hand, as in the case of all great enterprises,
loud voices were raised in opposition.
To send parties of men and women to starve
in the wilderness, or be murdered by savages or
Spaniards, was a proceeding worthy of severe
condemnation for its shocking cruelty, to say nothing
of its useless extravagance. Then, as usual,
the men who could see a few inches in front of
their noses called themselves wise and practical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
while they stigmatized as visionary theorizers the
men whose imaginations could discern, albeit in
dim outlines, the great future. As for the queen,
who clearly approved in her innermost heart the
schemes of Raleigh and Hakluyt, not much was to
be expected from her when it came to a question
of spending money. Elizabeth carried into the
management of public affairs a miserly spirit inherited,
perhaps, from her grandfather, Henry
VII. When the Armada was actually
entering the Channel she deemed it
sound economy to let her sailors get
sick with sour ale rather than throw it away and
buy fresh for them. Such a mind was not likely
to appreciate the necessity for the enormous immediate
outlay involved in planting a successful
colony. That such a document as Hakluyt's
should be laid away and forgotten was no more
than natural. To blame Elizabeth unreservedly,
however, without making some allowance for the
circumstances in which she was placed, would be
crude and unfair. It was the public money that
she was called upon to spend, and the military
pressure exerted by Spain made heavy demands
upon it. In spite of her pennywise methods,
which were often so provoking, they were probably
less ill suited to that pinching crisis than her
father's ready lavishness would have been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The beginnings of joint-stock companies.</div>

<p>That Raleigh should appeal to the sovereign for
aid in his enterprise was to have been expected.
It was what all explorers and colonizers had been
in the habit of doing. Since the days of Prince
Henry the Navigator the arduous work of discov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>ering
and subduing the heathen world outside of
Europe had been conducted under government
control and paid from the public purse whenever
the plunder of the heathen did not suffice. In
some cases the sovereign was unwilling to allow
private capital to embark in such enterprises; as
for example in the spring of 1491, when the Duke
of Medina-Celi offered to fit out two or three
caravels for Columbus and Queen Isabella refused
to give him the requisite license, probably because
she was "unwilling to have the duke come in for
a large share of the profits in case the venture
should prove successful."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Usually, however, such
work was beyond the reach of private purses, and
it was not until the middle of the sixteenth
century, and in such commercial
countries as the Netherlands and England,
with comparatively free governments, that
joint-stock companies began to be formed for such
purposes. I have already alluded to the famous
Muscovy Company, first formed in the reign of
Edward VI., and from that time forth the joint-stock
principle went on rapidly gaining strength
until its approach to maturity was announced by
the creation of the English East India Company
in 1600 and the Dutch East India Company in
1602. The latter was "the first great joint-stock
company whose shares were bought and sold from
hand to hand,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and these events mark the beginning
of a new era in European commerce.</p>

<p>This substitution of voluntary coöperation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
among interested individuals for compulsory action
under government control was one of the
most important steps taken toward bringing in the
modern era. Americans have no reason to regret
that the beginnings of English colonization in the
New World were not made by an English sovereign.
There can be no doubt that the very slight
connection between these colonies and the Crown
was from the first extremely favourable to their
free and untrammelled development. Far better
that the worthy Hakluyt's essay should get tucked
away in a pigeon-hole than that it should have fired
Elizabeth to such zeal for Virginia as Louis XIV.
a century afterward showed for New France!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Raleigh's difficulties.</div>

<p>By 1589 Raleigh seems to have despaired of
finding the queen disposed to act as a fairy godmother.
He reckoned that he had already spent
£40,000 on Virginia, although this sum may perhaps
have included his contributions toward the
Arctic voyages of John Davis. Such a sum would
be equivalent to not less than $1,000,000 of our
modern money, and no wonder if Raleigh began
to feel more than ever that the undertaking was
too great for his individual resources. In March,
1589, we find him, as governor of Virginia,
assigning not his domain but the
right to trade there to a company, of which John
White, Thomas Smith, and Rev. Richard Hakluyt
were the most prominent members. He reserved
for himself a royalty of one fifth of all the
gold and silver that should be obtained. The
Company did not show much activity. We may
well believe that it was too soon after the Armada.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Business affairs had not had time to recover from
that severe strain. But Raleigh never lost sight
of Virginia. Southey's accusation that he sent
out colonists and then abandoned them was ill-considered.
We have already seen why it proved
impossible to send help to John White's colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great Spanish carrack.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Mermaid Tavern.</div>

<div class="sidenote">King James I.</div>

<p>In the pursuit of his various interests the
all-accomplished knight sometimes encountered
strange vicissitudes. With all his flattery of the
crowned coquette, Elizabeth Tudor, the true sovereign
of his heart was one of the ladies of the court,
the young and beautiful Elizabeth Throckmorton.
To our prosaic modern minds the attitude of the
great queen toward the favourite courtiers whom
she could by no possibility dream of raising to the
dignity of prince-consort seems incomprehensible.
But after a due perusal of the English dramatists
of the time, the romance of Sidney, the extravagances
of Lyly, the poetry of Spenser and Ronsard,
or some of those tales of chivalry that turned
good Don Quixote's brain, we are beguiled into
the right sort of atmosphere for understanding it.
For any of Elizabeth's counsellors or favourites to
make love to any other lady was apt to call down
some manifestation of displeasure, and in 1592
some circumstances connected with Raleigh's marriage<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
led to his imprisonment in the Tower. But
his evil star was not yet in the ascendant. Within
a few weeks one of his captains, Christopher Newport,
whom we shall meet again, brought into Dartmouth
harbour the great Spanish carrack Madre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>de Dios, with treasure from the Indies worth
nearly four millions of modern dollars.
A large part of Raleigh's own share in
the booty was turned over to his sovereign
with that blithesome grace in which none could
rival him, and it served as a ransom. In 1594 we
find him commanding an expedition to Guiana
and exploring the vast solitudes of the Orinoco in
search of El Dorado. On his return to England
he found a brief interval of leisure in which to
write that fascinating book on Guiana which David
Hume declared to be full of lies, a gross calumny
which subsequent knowledge, gathered by Humboldt
and since his time, has entirely refuted.
Then came the great battle at Cadiz in 1596,
already mentioned, and the capture of Fayal in
1597, when Raleigh's fame reached its zenith.
About this time, or soon after, began those ambrosial
nights, those feasts of the gods, at
the Mermaid Tavern, where Selden and
Camden, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben
Jonson and Dr. Donne, sat around the table with
Raleigh and Shakespeare. In that happy time the
opportunity for colonizing Virginia seemed once
more to have come, and in 1602 Raleigh sent out
Samuel Mace on an expedition of which less is
known than one could wish, save that renewed
search was made for White's lost colony. Otherwise,
says the historian Stith, this Mace "performed
nothing, but returned with idle stories and
frivolous allegations."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> When he arrived in England
in 1603, sad changes had occurred. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>great queen&mdash;great and admirable with all her
faults&mdash;had passed away, and a quaint pedantic
little Scotchman, with uncouth figure and
shambling gait and a thickness of utterance
due partly to an ill-formed tongue and partly
to excessive indulgence in mountain dew, had
stepped into her place. A web of intrigue, basely
woven by Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, had
caught Raleigh in its meshes. He was hurried off
to the Tower, while an attainder bereft him of his
demesne of Virginia and handed it over to the
crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry, Earl of Southampton.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gosnold, Pring and Weymouth.</div>

<p>But other strong hands were taking up the work.
That Earl of Southampton to whom Shakespeare
ten years before had dedicated his "Venus
and Adonis" had been implicated in
Essex's rebellion and narrowly escaped
with his life. The accession of James I., which
was fraught with such ill for Raleigh, set Southampton
free. But already in 1602, while he was
still a prisoner in the Tower, an expedition organized
under his auspices set sail for Virginia. It
was commanded by one of Raleigh's old captains,
Bartholomew Gosnold, and has especial interest as
an event in the beginnings alike of Virginia and
of New England. Gosnold came to a region which
some persons called Norumbega, but was
soon to be known for a few years as
North Virginia, and always thereafter
as New England. It was he who first wrote
upon the map the names Cape Cod and Martha's
Vineyard, and the Elizabeth Islands in what we
call Buzzard's Bay. His return to England was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the occasion of a fresh and strong renewal of interest
in the business of what Hakluyt called "western
planting." The voyage of Martin Pring to
North Virginia, at the expense of sundry Bristol
merchants, followed in 1603, and at the same
time Bartholomew Gilbert, son of Sir Humphrey,
coasted the shores of Chesapeake Bay, and was
slain by the Indians with several of his men.
Early in 1605 Captain George Weymouth set out
in a vessel equipped by the Earl of Southampton,
Lord Arundel of Wardour, and Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, governor of the garrison at Plymouth.
After spending a month in North Virginia, Weymouth
returned to England with five captive Indians,
and the popular interest aroused by his
arrival surpassed that which had been felt upon
former occasions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Eastward Ho!"</div>

<p>The excitement over Virginia was promptly reflected
upon the stage. The comedy of "Eastward
Ho," written by Chapman and Marston, with
contributions from Ben Jonson, was acted in 1605
and published in the autumn of that year. The
title is a survival of forms of speech current when
America was believed to be a part of the oriental
world. Some extracts from this play will serve
to illustrate the popular feeling. In the second
act old Security, the money lender, is
talking with young Frank Quicksilver
about the schemes of Sir Petronel Flash. Quicksilver
says, "Well, dad, let him have money; all
he could anyway get is bestowed on a ship, nowe
bound for Virginia." Security replies, "Now a
frank gale of wind go with him, Master Frank!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
We have too few such knight adventurers. Who
would not sell away competent certainties to purchase
(with any danger) excellent uncertainties?
Your true knight venturer ever does it." In the
next act a messenger enters.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Messenger.</i> Sir Petronel, here are three or four gentlemen

<p><i>Petronel.</i> What are they?</p>

<p><i>Scapethrift.</i> Fill all the pots in your house with all

in their pewter coats; and though we do not employ
them now, yet we will maintain 'em till we do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Drawer.</i> Said like an honourable captain; you shall
have all you can command, sir.      [<i>Exit Drawer.</i></p>

<p><i>Seagull.</i> Come boys, Virginia longs till we share the
rest of her....</p>

<p><i>Spendall.</i> Why, is she inhabited already with any
English?</p>

<p><i>Seagull.</i> A whole country of English is there, bred
of those that were left there in '79 [Here our dramatist's
date is wrong; White's colony, left there in 1587,
is meant]; they have married [continues Seagull] with
the Indians ... [who] are so in love with them that
all the treasure they have they lay at their feet.</p>

<p><i>Scapethrift.</i> But is there such treasure there, Captain,
as I have heard?</p>

<p><i>Seagull.</i> I tell thee, gold is more plentiful there than
copper is with us; and for as much red copper as I can
bring I'll have thrice the weight in gold. Why, man,
all their dripping-pans ... are pure gold; and all the
chains with which they chain up their streets are massy
gold; all the prisoners they take are fettered in gold;
and for rubies and diamonds they go forth on holidays
and gather 'em by the seashore to hang on their children's
coats, and stick in their children's caps, as commonly
as our children wear saffron-gilt brooches and
groats with holes in 'em.</p>

<p><i>Scapethrift.</i> And is it a pleasant country withal?</p>

<p><i>Seagull.</i> As ever the sun shined on: temperate, and
full of all sorts of excellent viands; wild boar is as common
there as our tamest bacon is here; venison as mutton.
And then you shall live freely there, without sergeants,
or courtiers, or lawyers.... Then for your
means to advancement, there it is simple and not preposterously
mixed. You may be an alderman there,
and never be scavenger; you may be any other officer,
and never be a slave. You may come to preferment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>enough, ... to riches and fortune enough, and have
never the more villainy nor the less wit. Besides, there
we shall have no more law than conscience, and not
too much of either; serve God enough, eat and drink
enough, and enough is as good as a feast.</p>

<p><i>Spendall.</i> Gods me! and how far is it thither?</p>

<p><i>Seagull.</i> Some six weeks sail, no more, with any indifferent
good wind. And if I get to any part of the
coast of Africa, I'll sail thither with any wind; or when
I come to Cape Finisterre, there's a fore-right wind continual
wafts us till we come to Virginia. See, our colonel's
come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zuñiga's report to Philip III.</div>

<p>The great popularity of this play, both on the
stage and in print,&mdash;for it went through four
editions between September and Christmas,&mdash;is
an indication of the general curiosity felt about
Virginia. The long war with Spain had lately
been brought to an end by the treaty of 1604. It
had left Spain so grievously weakened that the
work of encroaching upon her American demesnes
was immeasurably easier than in the days when
Hawkins began it and Elizabeth connived at it. In
a cipher despatch from the Spanish ambassador
Zuñiga to his sovereign, Philip
III., dated London, March 16, 1606,
N. S., mention is made of an unpalatable scheme
of the English: "They also propose to do another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
thing, which, is to send five or six hundred men,
private individuals of this kingdom, to people Virginia
in the Indies, close to Florida. They sent
to that country some small number of men in
years gone by, and having afterwards sent again,
they found a part of them alive."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In this reference
to White's colony the Spaniard is of course
mistaken; no living remnant was ever found. He
goes on to say that the principal leader in this
business is Sir John Popham, Lord Chief Justice
of England, who is a terrible Puritan; and when
reminded that this enterprise is an encroachment
upon Spanish territory and a violation of the
treaty, this astute judge says that he is only undertaking
it in order to clear England of thieves
and get them drowned in the sea. I have not yet
complained of this to the king, says Zuñiga, but
I shall do so.</p>

HANC CHARTAM DEDICABAT 1582</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">First charter of Virginia, 1606.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The "Sea of Verrazano".</div>

<p>It was very soon after this despatch, on April
10, O. S., that James I. issued the charter under
which England's first permanent colony
was established. This memorable document
begins by defining the territorial
limits of Virginia, which is declared to extend
from the 34th to the 45th parallel of latitude,
and from the seashore one hundred miles inland.
In a second charter, issued three years later, Virginia
is described as extending from sea to sea,
that is, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. It
is not likely that the king and his advisers understood
the westward extension of the grant, as here
specified, to be materially different from that mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>in the first charter. The width of the continent
between Chesapeake Bay and the valley of
the St. Lawrence was supposed to be no greater
than from one to two hundred miles. It is true
that before the middle of the sixteenth century the
expeditions of Soto and Coronado had proved the
existence of a continuous mass of land from Florida
to California, but many geographers believed
that this continental mass terminated at the 40th
parallel or even some degrees lower, and that its
northern coast was washed by an enormous bay of
the Pacific Ocean, called on old maps
the Sea of Verrazano. The coast land
from Virginia to Labrador was regarded as a thin
strip separating the two oceans after somewhat the
same fashion as Central America, and hence the
mouths and lower reaches of such broad rivers as
the Hudson and the Delaware were mistaken for
straits. After one has traced the slow development
of knowledge through the curious mingling
of fact with fancy in the maps of Baptista Agnese
published in 1536, and that of Sebastian Münster
in 1540, down to the map which Michael Lok
made for Sir Philip Sidney in 1582, he will have
no difficulty in understanding either the language
of the early charters or the fact that such a navigator
as Henry Hudson should about this time
have entered New York harbour in the hope of
coming out upon the Pacific Ocean within a few
days. Without such study of the old maps the
story often becomes incomprehensible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Northern and southern limits of Virginia.</div>

<p>As for the northern and southern limits of Virginia,
they were evidently prescribed with a view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to arousing as little antagonism as possible on the
part of Spain and France. Expressed in
terms of the modern map, the 34th parallel
cuts through the mouth of the Cape
Fear River and passes just south of Columbia,
the capital of South Carolina; while the 45th parallel
is that which divides Vermont from Canada.
English settlers were thus kept quite clear of the
actual settlements of Spaniards in Florida, and
would not immediately be brought into collision
with the French friars and fur-traders who were
beginning to find their way up the St. Lawrence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The twin joint-stock companies, and the three zones.</div>

<p>The Virginia thus designated was to be open
for colonization by two joint-stock companies, of
which the immediate members and such
as should participate with them in the
enterprise should be called respectively
the First Colony and the Second Colony.
The First Colony was permitted to occupy
the territory between the 34th and the 41st parallels,
while the Second Colony was permitted to
occupy the territory between the 38th and the 45th
parallels. It will thus be observed that the strip
between the 38th and 41st parallels was open to
both, but it was provided that neither colony
should make a plantation or settlement within a
hundred miles of any settlement already begun
by the other. The elaborate ingenuity of this
arrangement is characteristic of James's little device-loving
mind; its purpose, no doubt, was to
quicken the proceedings by offering to reward
whichever colony should be first in the field with
a prior claim upon the intervening region. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
practical result was the division of the Virginia
territory into three strips or zones. The southern
zone, starting from the coast comprised between
the mouth of the Cape Fear River and the mouth
of the Potomac, was secured to the First Colony.
The northern zone, starting from the coast comprised
between the Bay of Fundy and Long Island
Sound, was secured to the Second Colony. The
middle zone, from the lower reaches of the Hudson
River down to the mouth of the Potomac, was
left open to competition between the two, with a
marked advantage in favour of the one that should
first come to be self-supporting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three zones in American history.</div>

<p>It is a curious fact that, although the actual
course taken by the colonization of North America
was very different from what was contemplated in
this charter, nevertheless the division of our territory
into the three zones just mentioned
has happened to coincide with a real and
very important division that exists to-day.
Of our original thirteen states, those of New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
Connecticut were founded in the northern zone,
and within it their people have spread through
central New York into the Far West. In the
middle zone, with the exception of a few northerly
towns upon the Hudson, were made the beginnings
of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
and Maryland. In the southern zone were
planted Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. Between
the three groups the differences in local
government have had much significance in the
history of the American people. In the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
zone the township system of local government has
prevailed, and in the southern zone the county
system, while in the middle zone the mixed township-and-county
system has exhibited various
phases, here and there reaching a very high stage
of development.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>To return to King James's charter, the government
which it provided for his two American colonies
was such as he believed would prove
of the two simple and efficient. A Royal Council
of Virginia, consisting of thirteen persons,
was created in London, and its members were
to be appointed by the king. It was to exercise a
general supervision over the two colonies, but the
direct management of affairs in each colony was
to be entrusted to local resident councils. Each
local council was to consist of thirteen persons, of
whom one was to be president, with a casting vote.
The council in London was to give the wheels of
government a start by appointing the first members
of the two colonial councils and designating
that member of each who should serve as president
for the first year. After that the vehicle was
to run of itself; the colonial council was to elect
its president each year, and could depose him in
case of misconduct; it could also fill its own vacancies,
arising from the resignation, deposition, departure,
or death of any of its members. Power was
given to the colonial council to coin money for
trade between the colonies and with the natives, to
invite and carry over settlers, to drive out intruders,
to punish malefactors, and to levy and collect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
duties upon divers imported goods. All lands
within the two colonies were to be held in free
and common socage, like the demesnes of the
manor of East Greenwich, in the county of Kent
and the settlers and their children forever were
to enjoy all the liberties, franchises, and immunities
enjoyed by Englishmen in England,&mdash;a
clause which was practically nullified by the failure
to provide for popular elections or any expression
whatever of public opinion. The authority of
the colonial councils was supreme within the colonies,
but their acts were liable to a veto from the
Crown.</p>

<p>This first English attempt at making an outline
of government for an English colony can never
fail to be of interest. It was an experimental
treatment of a wholly new and unfamiliar problem,
and, as we shall hereafter see, it was soon proved
to be a very crude experiment, needing much modification.
For the present we are concerned with
the names and characters of the persons to whom
this ever-memorable charter was granted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persons chiefly interested in the First Colony; the London Company.</div>

<p>The persons interested in the First Colony, in
that southern zone which had been the scene of
Raleigh's original attempts, were represented
by some eminent citizens of London
and its neighbourhood, so that they
came afterward to be commonly known
as the London Company. The names
mentioned in the charter are four: the Rev. Richard
Hakluyt, who had lately been made a prebendary
of Westminster; Sir Thomas Gates, Sir
George Somers, and Captain Edward Maria Wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>field.
Gates was a Devonshire soldier who had been
knighted in 1596 for brave conduct in the battle
of Cadiz, and had afterward served in the Netherlands.
Somers was a native of Dorsetshire, and
had received knighthood for eminent services as
commander in several naval expeditions against
the Spaniards. Captain Edward Maria Wingfield,
of Stoneley Priory, in Huntingdonshire, was
of a very ancient and honourable Catholic family;
Queen Mary Tudor and Cardinal Pole had been
sponsors for his father, which accounts for the
feminine middle name; he had served in the
Netherlands and in Ireland; among his near relatives,
or connections by marriage, were Shakespeare's
Earl of Southampton, the lords Carew
and Hervey, and John Winthrop, of Groton, afterwards
governor of Massachusetts. But the name
which, after Hakluyt's, has been perhaps most
closely identified with the London Company is
that of Sir Thomas Smith, the eminent London
citizen who was its first treasurer. From the time
of his student days at Oxford Smith felt a strong
interest in "western planting," and we have already
met with his name on the list of those to
whom Raleigh in 1589 assigned his trading interests
in Virginia. He was knighted in 1596 for
gallantry at Cadiz, was alderman and sheriff of
London, and first governor of the East India
Company in 1600. He was at various times a
member of Parliament, served as ambassador to
Russia, and was especially forward in promoting
Arctic discovery. He was one of those who sent
Henry Hudson in 1610 upon his last fatal voyage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and it was under his auspices that William Baffin
was sailing in 1616 when he discovered that remote
strait leading to the Polar Sea which has ever
since been known as Smith's Sound. Few men of
that time contributed more largely in time and
money to the London Company than Sir Thomas
Smith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persons chiefly interested in the Second Colony; the Plymouth Company.</div>

<p>The persons interested in the Second Colony, in
that northern zone to which attention had recently
been directed by the voyages of Gosnold,
Pring, and Weymouth, were represented
by certain gentlemen connected with the
western counties, especially by Ferdinando
Gorges, governor of the garrison
at Plymouth in Devonshire, who was afterwards
to be Lord Proprietor of the Province of Maine,
and to play a part of some importance in the early
history of New England. This company came to
be known as the Plymouth Company. The four
names mentioned in the charter are Raleigh Gilbert,
William Parker, Thomas Hanham, and
George Popham. The name of the first of these
gentlemen tells its own story; he was a younger
son of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and named for his
uncle. William Parker was son and heir of Lord
Morley, and commonly known by his courtesy title
as Lord Monteagle. It was he who received the
anonymous letter which led to the detection of the
Gunpowder Plot, in which his wife's brother was
concerned. George Popham was a nephew,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and
Thomas Hanham was a grandson, of Sir John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Popham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench.
They were a Somersetshire family. In securing
the charter incorporating the London and Plymouth
companies nobody was more active or influential
than the chief justice, whom we have
seen singled out for mention by the Spanish ambassador.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other eminent persons interested in the scheme.</div>

<p>Among other persons especially interested in
the colonization of Virginia, one should mention
George Abbot, Master of University
College, Oxford, one of the translators
of the common version of the Bible,
afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury; and Sir
Julius Cæsar, member of Parliament for Westminster
and Chancellor of the Exchequer, son of
Julius Cæsar Adelmare, Queen Elizabeth's Italian
physician; his strong interest in maritime discovery
and western planting may have been due to
the fact that, after the death of his father and
while he was still a child, his mother married the
celebrated geographer, Dr. Michael Lok. We
should not forget Sir Maurice Berkeley, two of
whose sons we shall meet hereafter, one of them,
Sir William Berkeley, the most conspicuous figure
among the royal governors of Virginia, the other,
Lord Berkeley of Stratton, one of the proprietors
of Carolina. An important subscriber to the company
was Sir Anthony Ashley, grandfather of the
famous Earl of Shaftesbury, who was also one of
the Carolina proprietors; another was William
Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, nephew of Sir Philip
Sidney and devoted friend of Shakespeare; another
was Sir Henry Cary, father of the pure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
high-minded statesman, Lucius, Viscount Falkland.
Of more importance for Virginian history
than any of the foregoing was Sir Edwin Sandys,
son of Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York. Sir
Edwin was a pupil of the great Richard Hooker,
and learned from him principles of toleration little
understood in that age. After his travels on the
continent he published in 1605 a treatise entitled
"Europæ Speculum, a relation of the state of religion
in ... these Western Parts of the World;"
its liberal opinions gave so much offence that about
four months after its publication it was burned in
St. Paul's Churchyard by order of the Court of
High Commission. At that very time Sandys was
one of the most admired and respected members of
the House of Commons, and it was on his motion
that the House first began keeping a regular journal
of its transactions. He was associated with
Sir Francis Bacon in drawing up the remonstrance
against King James's behaviour toward Parliament.
In later years he was an active friend of
the Mayflower Pilgrims and gave them valuable
aid in setting out upon their enterprise. But his
chief title to historic fame consists in the fact that
it was under his auspices and largely through his
exertions that free representative government was
first established in America. How this came about
will be shown in a future chapter. For the present
we may note that at least half a dozen of his
immediate family were subscribers to the London
Company; one of his brothers had for godfather
Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlecote Hall, the Puritan
knight who figures as Justice Shallow in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
"Merry Wives of Windsor;" there were at least
two intermarriages between this Sandys family and
that of Lawrence Washington, of Sulgrave, ancestor
of George Washington. It is pleasant to trace
the various connections, near and remote, whether
in blood-relationship or in community of interests
and purposes, between the different personages of
a great era that has passed away; for the more we
come to discern in its concrete details the intricate
web of associations running in all directions among
the men and events of the vanished age, the more
vividly is that age reproduced in our minds, the
closer does it come to the present, the more keenly
does it enlist our sympathies. As we contemplate
the goodly array here brought forward of personages
concerned in the first planting of an English
nation in America, the inquiry as to what sort of
men they were, for intelligence and character, is
one that can be answered with satisfaction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition of the Plymouth Company; failure of the Popham Colony.</div>

<p>In accordance with the provisions of the charter,
both London and Plymouth companies made haste
to organize expeditions for planting their colonies
in the New World. The London Company was
the first to be ready, but before we follow its adventures
a word about the Plymouth Company
seems called for. On the last day of May, 1607,
two ships&mdash;the Gift of God, commanded by
George Popham, and the Mary and John,
commanded by Raleigh Gilbert&mdash;set
sail from Plymouth with a hundred settlers
In August, after some exploration
of the coast, they selected a site by the
mouth of the Kennebec River, and built there a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
rude fort with twelve guns, a storehouse and
church, and a few cabins. They searched diligently
but in vain for traces of gold or silver; the winter
brought with it much hardship, their storehouse
was burned down, and Captain Popham died. In
the spring a ship which arrived with supplies from
England brought the news of two deaths, that of
Chief Justice Popham, and that of Gilbert's elder
brother, to whose estates he was heir. The enterprise
was forthwith abandoned and all returned
to England with most discouraging reports. The
further career of the Plymouth Company does
not at present concern us. It never achieved any
notable success. When the colonization of New
England was at length accomplished it was in a
manner that was little dreamed of by the king who
granted or the men who obtained the charter of
1606.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition of the London Company.</div>

<p>The expedition fitted out by the London Company
was in readiness a little before Christmas
1606, and was placed under command of
Captain Christopher Newport, the stout
sailor who had brought in the great
Spanish carrack for Raleigh. He was one of the
most skilful and highly esteemed officers in the
English navy. Of the three ships that were to
go to Virginia his was the Susan Constant. The
Godspeed was commanded by Bartholomew Gosnold,
and the Discovery by John Ratcliffe. Besides
their crews, the three ships carried 105 colonists.
By some queer freak of policy the names
of the persons appointed to the colonial council
were carried in a sealed box, not to be opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
until the little squadron should arrive at its destination.
An important paper of instructions was
drawn up for the use of the officers on landing.
Hakluyt was commonly called upon to prepare
such documents, and the style of this one sounds
like him. The suggestions are those of a man
who understood the business.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Instructions to the colonists.</div>

<p>"When it shall please God to send you on the
coast of Virginia, you shall do your best endeavour
to find out a safe port in the entrance
of some navigable river, making choice
of such a one as runneth farthest into
the land.... When you have made choice of the
river on which you mean to settle, be not hasty in
landing your victuals and munitions, but first let
Captain Newport discover how far that river may
be found navigable, that you make election of the
strongest, most wholesome and fertile place, for if
you make many removes, besides the loss of time,
you shall greatly spoil your victuals and your
casks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where to choose a site for a town.</div>

<p>"But if you choose your place so far up as a
bark of 50 tons will float, then you may lay all
your provisions ashore with ease, and the
better receive the trade of all the countries
about you in the land; and such a
place you may perchance find a hundred miles from
the river's mouth, and the further up the better,
for if you sit down near the entrance, except it be
in some island that is strong by nature, an enemy
that may approach you on even ground may easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
pull you out; <i>and</i> [<i>i. e.</i> but] if he be driven to
seek you a hundred miles <i>the</i> [<i>i. e.</i> in] land in
boats, you shall from both sides of the river where
it is narrowest, so beat them with your muskets as
they shall never be able to prevail against you."</p>

<p>That the enemy in the writer's mind was the
Spaniard is clearly shown by the next paragraph,
which refers expressly to the massacre of the Huguenot
colony in Florida and the vengeance taken
by Dominique de Gourgues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Precautions against a surprise.</div>

<p>"And to the end that you be not surprised as the
French were in Florida by Melindus [<i>i. e.</i> Menendez]
and the Spaniard in the same place
by the French, you shall do well to make
this double provision: first erect a little
store at the mouth of the river that may lodge
some ten men, with whom you shall leave a light
boat, that when any fleet shall be in sight they
may come with speed to give you warning. Secondly,
you must in no case suffer any of the native
people to inhabit between you and the sea-coast,
for you cannot carry yourselves so towards them
but they will grow discontented with your habitation,
and be ready to guide and assist any nation
that shall come to invade you; and if you neglect
this you neglect your safety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">You must try to find the Pacific Ocean.</div>

<p>"You must observe if you can whether the river
on which you plant doth spring out of mountains
or out of lakes. If it be out of any lake
the passage to the other sea [<i>i. e.</i> the
Pacific Ocean] will be the more easy;
and [it] is like enough that out of the same lake
you shall find some [rivers] spring which run the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
contrary way toward the East India Sea, for the
great and famous rivers of Volga, Tanais, and
Dwina have three heads near joined, and yet the
one falleth into the Caspian Sea, the other into
the Euxine Sea, and the third into the Polonian
Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Do not offend the natives, or put much trust in them.</div>

<p>"... You must have great care not to offend
the naturals, if you can eschew it, and employ some
few of your company to trade with them
for corn and all other lasting victuals ...,
and this you must do before that they
perceive you mean to plant among them....
Your discoverers that pass over land with
hired guides must look well to them that they slip
not from them, and for more assurance let them
take a compass with them, and write down how far
they go upon every point of the compass, for that
country having no way or path, if that your guides
run from you in the great woods or desert, you
shall hardly ever find a passage back. And how
weary soever your soldiers be, let them never trust
the country people with the carriage of their weapons,
for if they run from you with your shot which
they only fear, they will easily kill <i>them</i> [<i>i. e.</i> you]
all with their arrows. And whensoever any of
yours shoots before them, be sure that they be
chosen out of your best marksmen, for if they see
your learners miss what they aim at, they will
think the weapon not so terrible, and thereby will
be bold to assault you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conceal from them your weaknesses.</div>

<p>"Above all things, do not advertise the killing
of any of your men [so] that the country people
may know it. If they perceive that they are but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>common men, and that with the loss of many of
theirs they may diminish any part of
yours, they will make many adventures
upon you.... You shall do well also
not to let them see or know of your sick men, if
you have any....</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beware of woodland converts.</div>

<p>"You must take especial care that you choose a
seat for habitation that shall not be overburthened
with woods near your town, for all the
men you have shall not be able to cleanse
twenty acres a year, besides that it may
serve for a covert for your enemies round about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Avoid malaria.</div>

<p>"Neither must you plant in a low or moist place,
because it will prove unhealthful. You shall judge
of the good air by the people, for some
part of that coast where the lands are
low have their people blear eyed, and with swollen
bellies and legs, but if the naturals be strong and
clean made it is a true sign of a wholesome soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Guard against desertion.</div>

<p>"You must take order to draw up the pinnace
that is left with you under the fort, and
take her sails and anchors ashore, all but
a small kedge to ride by, lest some ill-disposed
persons slip away with her."</p>

<p>The document contains many other excellent
suggestions and directions, two or three of which
will suffice for the purposes of our narrative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Build your town carefully.</div>

<p>"Seeing order is at the same price with confusion
it shall be advisably done to set your houses
even and by a line, that your streets
may have a good breadth and be carried
square about your market-place, and
every street's end opening into it, that from thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
with a few field-pieces you may command every
street throughout....</p>

<div class="sidenote">Do not send home any discouraging news.</div>

<p>"You shall do well to send a perfect relation by
Captain Newport of all that is done, what height
you are seated, how far into the land,
what commodities you find, what soil,
woods and their several kinds, and so of
all other things else, to advertise particularly;
and to suffer no man to return but by passport
from the President and Council, nor to write [in]
any letter of anything that may discourage others.</p>

<p>"Lastly and chiefly, the way to prosper and
achieve good success is to make yourselves all of
one mind for the good of your country and your
own, and to serve and fear God, the Giver of all
goodness, for every plantation which our Heavenly
Father hath not planted shall be rooted out."</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Spain thought of it.</div>

<p>The allusion to the Florida tragedy, in this
charming paper, was by no means ill considered.
For in March, 1607, the King of Spain wrote from
Madrid to Zuñiga in London as follows: "You
will report to me what the English are doing in
the matter of Virginia; and if the plan
progresses which they contemplated, of
sending men there and ships; and thereupon
it will be taken into consideration here what
steps had best be taken to prevent it."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> A few
days after this letter Philip III. held a meeting
with his council to discuss measures which boded
no good to Captain Newport's little company. We
do not know just what was said and done, but we
hardly need to be told that the temper of Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
was notably changed in the forty-two years since
Menendez's deed of blood. How to ruin the Virginia
enterprise without coming to blows with England
was now the humbler problem for Spain to
solve, and it was not an easy one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A poet laureate's farewell blessing.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Newport's little fleet was half way
on its voyage. It started down the Thames from
Blackwall on the 19th of December, but by reason
of "unprosperous winds" it was obliged
to keep its moorings "all in the Downs,"
as in the ballad of "Black-eyed Susan,"
until New Year's Day, 1607, when it finally got
under way. A farewell blessing was wafted to
them in Michael Drayton's quaint stanzas:<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="c">THE LAND OF THE POWHATANS.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Captain John Smith.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Captain Christopher Newport, with the
ships of the London Company, is still in mid-ocean,
and the seal of the king's casket containing
the names of Virginia's first rulers is still unbroken,
we may pause for a moment in our narrative,
to bestow a few words upon the early career
of the personage that is next to come upon the
scene,&mdash;a man whose various and wild adventures
have invested the homeliest of English names with
a romantic interest that can never die.
The life of Captain John Smith reads like
a chapter from "The Cloister and the Hearth." It
abounds in incidents such as we call improbable in
novels, although precedents enough for every one of
them may be found in real life. The accumulation
of romantic adventures in the career of a single
individual may sometimes lend an air of exaggeration
to the story; yet in the genius for getting into
scrapes and coming out of them sound and whole,
the differences between people are quite as great
as the differences in stature and complexion. John
Smith evidently had a genius for adventures, and
he lived at a time when one would often meet with
things such as nowadays seldom happen in civilized
countries. In these days of Pullman cars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and organized police we are liable to forget the
kind of perils that used to dog men's footsteps
through the world. The romance of human life
has by no means disappeared, but it has somewhat
changed its character since the Elizabethan age,
and is apt to consist of different kinds of incidents,
so that the present generation has witnessed a tendency
to disbelieve many stories of the older time.
In the case of John Smith, for whose early life we
have little else but his autobiography to go by,
much incredulity has been expressed.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> To set him
down as an arrant braggadocio would seem to some
critics essential to their reputation for sound sense.
Such a judgment, however, may simply show that
the critic has failed to realize all the conditions
of the case. Queer things could happen in the
Tudor times. Lord Campbell tells us that Sir
John Popham, when he was a law-student in the
Middle Temple, used after nightfall to go out with
his pistols and take purses on Hounslow Heath,
partly to show that he was a young man of spirit,
partly to recruit his meagre finances, impaired by
riotous living.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This amateur highwayman lived
to become Chief Justice of England. The age in
which such things could be done was that in which
John Smith grew to manhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His early life.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A cruise in the Mediterranean.</div>

<p>A Latin entry in the parish register at Wil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>loughby
in Lincolnshire shows that he received
infant baptism in the church there on the 9th of
January, 1580. After the death of his parents,
an irrepressible craving for adventure led him at
an early age to France, where he served as a soldier
for a while and afterward spent three years
in the Netherlands fighting against the
Spaniards. In the year 1600 he returned
to Willoughby, "where within a short
time, being glutted with too much company
wherein he took small delight, he retired himself
into a little woody pasture a good way from any
town, environed with many hundred acres of
woods. Here by a fair brook he built a pavilion
of boughs where only in his clothes he lay. His
study was Machiavelli's Art of War and Marcus
Aurelius; his exercise a good horse, with lance
and ring; his food was thought to be more of
venison than anything else."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> However, he adds,
these hermit-like pleasures could not content him
long. "He was desirous to see more of the world,
and try his fortune against the Turks; both lamenting
and repenting to have seen so many
Christians slaughtering one another." In passing
through France he was robbed of all he had about
him, but his life was saved by a peasant who found
him lying in the forest, half dead with hunger and
grief and nearly frozen. He made his way to
Marseilles, and embarked with a company of pilgrims
for the Levant; but a violent storm arose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
which they said was all because of their having
this heretic on board, and so, like Jonah, the
young adventurer was thrown into the sea. He
was a good swimmer, however, and "God brought
him," he says, to a little island with no inhabitants
but a few kine and goats. Next morning he
was picked up by a Breton vessel which carried
him as far as Egypt and Cyprus. The commanding
officer, Captain La Roche, who knew some of
Smith's friends in France, treated him with great
kindness and consideration. On their
return voyage, at the entrance of the
Adriatic Sea, a Venetian argosy fired
upon them, and a hot fight ensued, until the Venetian
struck her colours. The Bretons robbed her
of an immense treasure in silks and velvets, besides
Turkish gold and silver coin, as much as they
could carry without overloading their own ship,
and then let her go on her way. When the spoil
was divided, Smith was allowed to share with the
rest, and thus received £225 in coin besides a box
of stuffs worth nearly as much more. After Captain
La Roche, of whom he speaks with warm
affection, had set him ashore in Piedmont, he
made a comfortable journey through Italy as far
as Naples, and seems to have learned much and
enjoyed himself in "sight seeing," quite like a
modern traveller. At Rome he saw Pope Clement
VIII. with several cardinals creeping on hands
and knees up the Holy Staircase. He called on
Father Parsons, the famous English Jesuit; he
"satisfied himself with the rarities of Rome;" he
visited in like manner Florence and Bologna, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
gradually made his way to Venice, and so on to
Gratz in Styria, where he entered the service of
the Emperor Rudolph II., and was presently put
in command of a company of 250 cavalry with the
rank of captain. On one occasion he made himself
useful by devising a system of signals, and on
another occasion by inventing a kind of rude
missiles which he called "fiery dragons," which
sorely annoyed the Turks by setting fire to their
camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three Turks' heads.</div>

<p>During the years 1601 and 1602 Smith saw
much rough campaigning. The troop to which
his company belonged passed into the service of
Sigismund<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Bathori, Prince of Transylvania; and
now comes the most notable incident in Smith's
narrative. The Transylvanians were besieging
Regal, one of their towns which the Turks had
occupied, and the siege made but little progress,
so that the barbarians from the top of the wall
hurled down sarcasms upon their assailants and
complained of growing fat for lack of exercise.
One day a Turkish captain sent a challenge, declaring
that "in order to delight the ladies, who
did long to see some court-like pastime,
he did defy any captain that had the command
of a company, who durst combat
with him for his head." The challenge was accepted
by the Christian army, it was decided to
select the champion by lot, and the lot fell upon
Smith. A truce was proclaimed for the single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
combat, the besieging army was drawn up in battle
array, the town walls were crowded with veiled
dames and turbaned warriors, the combatants on
their horses politely exchanged salutes, and then
rushed at each other with levelled lances. At the
first thrust Smith killed the Turk, and dismounting
unfastened his helmet, cut off his head, and
carried it to the commanding general, Moses
Tzekely, who accepted it graciously. The Turks
were so chagrined that one of their captains sent
a personal challenge to Smith, and next day the
scene was repeated. This time both lances were
shivered and recourse was had to pistols, the Turk
received a ball which threw him to the ground,
and then Smith beheaded him. Some time afterward
our victorious champion sent a message into
the town "that the ladies might know he was not
so much enamoured of their servants' heads, but if
any Turk of their rank would come to the place of
combat to redeem them, he should have his also
upon the like conditions, if he could win it." The
defiance was accepted. This time the Turk, having
the choice of weapons, chose battle-axes and
pressed Smith so hard that his axe flew from his
hand, whereat loud cheers arose from the rampart;
but with a quick movement of his horse he
dodged his enemy's next blow, and drawing his
sword gave him a fearful thrust in the side which
settled the affair; in another moment Smith had
his head. At a later time, after Prince Sigismund
had heard of these exploits, he granted to Smith a
coat-of-arms with three Turks' heads in a shield.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The entry in the Heralds' College.</div>

<p>This story forcibly reminds us that the Middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Ages, which had completely passed away from
France and Italy, the Netherlands and England,
still survived at the beginning of the seventeenth
century in the eastern parts of Europe. In the
Middle Ages such "court-like pastime," in the intervals
of relaxation from more serious warfare,
was not unfashionable. Still, though the incidents
are by no means incredible, the story has enough
of the look of an old soldier's yarn to excuse a moment's
doubt of it. Surely here if anywhere Smith
may seem to be drawing the long bow. But at the
Heralds' College in London, in the official register
of grants of arms, there is an entry in Latin which
does not sustain such a doubt. It is the record
of a coat-of-arms granted by Sigismund Bathori,
Prince of Transylvania, "to John Smith,
captain of 250 soldiers, etc. ... in memory
of three Turks' heads which with his
sword before the town of Regal he did overcome,
kill, and cut off, in the province of Transylvania."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The document on record, which contains this mention
of the grant, is a letter of safe conduct dated
December 9, 1603, signed by Sigismund at Leipsic
and given by him to Smith. The entry is duly
approved, and the genuineness of Sigismund's seal
and signature certified, by Sir William Segar,
Garter King at Arms. Some critics have suggested
that Smith may have imposed upon Segar
with a bogus document, and since the entry at the
Heralds' College was made in 1625, it is urged
that such a long delay in registering invests the
whole affair with suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Farnese's manuscript history.</div>

<p>The document, however, cannot be thus summarily
set aside. In the year 1625 Rev. Samuel
Purchas published the second volume of his delightful
<i>Pilgrimes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and in the course of it he
devotes several pages to Captain Smith's adventures
in the east of Europe, including the story
of the three Turks as above given. Purchas's authority
for the story was "a Booke intituled The
Warres of Transylvania, Wallachi, and Moldavia,"
written in Italian by Francesco Farnese, secretary
to Prince Sigismund. This history seems
never to have been published in its original
form, and the manuscript is now
apparently lost,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> but there can be no doubt that
Purchas had it, or a copy of it, in his hands about
1623. Smith's own book entitled "True Travels"
was not published until 1629, so that our original
authority for this passage at arms is not Smith
himself, but one of Prince Sigismund's secretaries,
who first told the story of the English captain's
exploit in a book written for Italian readers.
To the flippant criticism which treats Smith as
a vapouring braggart, this simple fact is a staggering
blow between the eyes. Let me add that
in his way of telling his tale there is no trace of
boastfulness.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> For freedom from egotistic self-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>consciousness
Smith's writings remind me strongly
of such books as the Memoirs of General Grant.
Inaccuracies that are manifest errors of memory
now and then occur, prejudices and errors of judgment
here and there confront us, but the stamp of
honesty I find on every page.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Smith is sold as a slave,</div>

<p>At the bloody battle of Rothenthurm, November
18, 1602, Smith was taken prisoner and sold into
slavery. At Constantinople the lady Charatza
Tragabigzanda, into the service of whose
family he passed, was able to talk with
him in Italian and treated him with kindness.
One can read between the lines that she may perhaps
have cherished a tender feeling for the young
Englishman, or that he may have thought so. It
would not have been strange. Smith's portrait,
as engraved and published during his lifetime, is
that of an attractive and noble-looking man. His
brief narrative does not make it clear how he regarded
the lady, or what relations they sustained
to each other, but she left an abiding impression
upon his memory. When in 1614 he explored the
coast of New England he gave the name Tragabigzanda
to the cape which Prince Charles afterwards
named Cape Anne, and the three little neighbouring
islands he called the Turks' Heads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and cruelly treated.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His escape,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and return to England.</div>

<p>The narrative is far from satisfying us as to
the reasons why Smith was sent away from Constantinople.
To the east of the Sea of Azov, and
bordering on the Cossack country, was a territory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>which Gerard Mercator calls Nalbrits, and Timour,
the Pasha of Nalbrits, was brother to the lady
Tragabigzanda. Thither she sent him, with a
request that he should be well treated; but the
rude Pasha paid no heed to his sister's message,
and our young hero was treated as badly as the
other slaves, of whom this tyrant had many.
"Among these slavish fortunes," says Smith,
"there was no great choice; for the best was so
bad, a dog could hardly have lived to
endure [it]." He was dressed in the skin
of a wild beast, had an iron collar fastened around
his neck, and was cuffed and kicked about until
he grew desperate. One day, as he was threshing
wheat in a lonely grange more than a league distant
from Timour's castle, the Pasha came in and
reviled and struck him, whereupon Smith suddenly
knocked him down with his threshing-stick and
beat his brains out. Then he stripped the body
and hid it under the straw, dressed up in the dead
man's clothes and mounted his horse, tied a sack
of grain to his saddle-bow, and galloped off into
the Scythian desert. The one tormenting fear was
of meeting some roving party of Turks who might
recognize the mark on his iron collar and either
send him back to his late master's place
or enslave him on their own account.
But in sixteen days of misery he saw nobody; then
he arrived at a Russian fortress on the Don and
got rid of his badge of slavery. He was helped
on his way from one Russian town to another, and
everywhere treated most kindly. Through the Polish
country he went, finding by the wayside much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>mirth and entertainment, and then through Hungary
and Bohemia, until at length he reached
Leipsic, where he found Prince Sigismund. It
was then, in December, 1603, that he obtained the
letter of safe conduct already mentioned. In the
course of the next year Smith travelled in Germany,
France, Spain, and Morocco, and after some
further adventures made his way back to
England in the nick of time for taking
part in the enterprise projected by the
London Company. Meeting with Newport and
Gosnold, and other captains who had visited the
shores of America, it was natural that his strong
geographical curiosity should combine with his love
of adventure to urge him to share in the enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The smoke of controversy.</div>

<p>The brevity of Smith's narrations now and then
leaves the story obscure. Like many another
charming old writer, he did not always consult
the convenience of the historians of a later age.
So much only is clear, that during the voyage
across the Atlantic the seeds of quarrel were sown
which bore fruit in much bitterness and wrangling
after the colonists had landed. Indeed,
after nearly three centuries some smoke
of the conflict still hovers about the field.
To this day John Smith is one of the personages
about whom writers of history are apt to lose their
tempers. In recent days there have been many
attempts to belittle him, but the turmoil that has
been made is itself a tribute to the potency and
incisiveness of his character. Weak men do not
call forth such belligerency. Amid all the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>flicting
statements, too, there comes out quite distinctly
the contemporary recognition of his dignity
and purity. Never was warrior known, says one
old writer, "from debts, wine, dice, and oaths so
free;"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> a staunch Puritan in morals, though not
in doctrine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A tedious voyage.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival in Chesapeake Bay.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Founding of Jamestown; Wingfield chosen president.</div>

<p>Captain Newport's voyage was a long one, for
he followed the traditional route, first running
down to the Canary Islands and then following
Columbus's route, wafted by the trade-wind
straight across to the West Indies.
It seems strange that he should have done so, for
the modern method of great-circle sailing,&mdash;first
practised on a great scale by Americus Vespucius,
in 1502, in his superb voyage of 4,000 miles in 33
days, from the ice-clad island of South Georgia to
Sierra Leone,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>&mdash;this more scientific method had
lately been adopted by Captain Gosnold, who in
1602 crossed directly from the English Channel
to Cape Cod. As Gosnold was now second in
command in this expedition to Virginia, it would
seem as if the shorter route might once more have
been tried to advantage. So many weeks upon the
ocean sadly diminished the stock of provisions.
In the course of the voyage some trouble arose
between Smith and Wingfield, and while they were
stopping at Dominica, on the 24th of March, an
accusation of plotting mutiny was brought against
the former, so that he was kept in irons until the
ships reached Virginia. After leaving the West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>Indies they encountered bad weather and lost their
reckoning, but the 26th of April brought them to
the cape which was forthwith named Henry, after
the Prince of Wales, as the opposite cape
was afterwards named for his younger
brother, Prince Charles. A few of the
company ventured on shore, where they were at
once attacked by Indians and two were badly
wounded with arrows. That evening the sealed
box was opened, and it was found that Bartholomew
Gosnold, Edward Wingfield, John Smith,
John Ratcliffe, John Martin, and George Kendall
were appointed members of the Council,&mdash;six in
all, of whom the president was to have two votes.
As the ships proceeded into Hampton Roads after
so much stress of weather, they named the promontory
at the entrance Point Comfort.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The name
of the broad river which the voyagers now entered
speaks for itself. They scrutinized the banks
until they found a spot which seemed suited for
a settlement, and there they landed on the 13th of
May. It was such a place as the worthy Hakluyt
(or whoever wrote their letter of instructions) had
emphatically warned them against, low and damp,
and liable to prove malarious.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> At high tide the
rising waters half covered the little peninsula, but
in this there was an element of military security,
for the narrow neck was easy to guard, and perhaps
it may have been such considerations that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>prevailed. Smith says there was a dispute between
Wingfield and Gosnold over the selection of this
site. As soon as the company had landed here
the members of the Council, all save Smith, were
sworn into office, and then they chose
Wingfield for their president for the first
year. On the next day the men went to
work at building their fort, a wooden
structure of triangular shape, with a demi-lune at
each angle, mounting cannon. They called it Fort
James, but soon the settlement came to be known
as Jamestown.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> For a church they nailed a board
between two trees to serve as a reading desk, and
stretched a canvas awning over it, and there the
Rev. Robert Hunt, a high-minded and courageous
divine, first clergyman of English America, read
the Episcopal service and preached a sermon twice
on every Sunday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Powhatan tribe, confederacy, and head war-chief.</div>

<p>Smith's enemies were a majority in the Council
and would not admit him as a member, but he was
no longer held as a prisoner. Newport's next
business was to explore the river, and Smith with
four other gentlemen, four skilled mariners, and
fourteen common sailors, went along with him,
while the Jamestown fort was building. They
sailed up about as far as the site of Richmond, frequently
meeting parties of Indians on the banks or
passing Indian villages. Newport was uniformly
kind and sagacious in his dealings with the red
men, and they seemed quite friendly. These were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>Algonquins, of the tribe called Powhatans, and the
natives who had assaulted the English at
Cape Henry belonged to a hostile tribe,
so that that incident furnished a bond
of sympathy between the Powhatans and
the white men. After a few days they reached the
village called Powhatan (<i>i.e.</i> "Falling Waters"),
which Thomas Studley, the colonial storekeeper,
describes as consisting of about a dozen houses
"pleasantly seated on a hill." Old drawings indicate
that they were large clan houses, with framework
of beams and covering of bark, similar in
general shape though not in all details to the long
houses of the Iroquois. The Powhatans seem to
have been the leading or senior tribe in a loose confederacy.
Their principal village was called Werowocomoco,
situated on the north side of the York
River, about fifteen miles northeast from Jamestown
as the crow flies. The place is now called
Putin Bay, a name which is merely a corruption of
Powhatan. At Werowocomoco dwelt the head
war-chief of the tribe, by name Wahunsunakok,
but much more generally known by his title as
The Powhatan, just as the head of an Irish or
Scotch clan is styled The O'Neill or The MacGregor.
Newport and Smith, hearing that The
Powhatan was a chief to whom other chiefs were
in a measure subordinate, spoke of him as the emperor
and the subordinate chiefs as kings, a grotesque
terminology which was natural enough at
that day but which in the interest of historical accuracy
it is high time for modern writers to drop.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>When Newport and Smith returned to Jamestown,
they found that it had been attacked by a
force of 200 Indians. Wingfield had beaten them
off, but one Englishman was killed and eleven
were wounded. In the course of the next two
weeks these enemies were very annoying; they
would crouch in the tall grass about the fort and
pick off a man with their barbed stone-tipped
arrows. Hakluyt had warned the settlers against
building near the edge of a wood;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> it seems strange
that bitter experience was needed to teach them
that danger might lurk in long grass. Presently
some of their new acquaintances from the Powhatan
tribe came to the fort and told Newport that
the assailants were from a hostile tribe against
which they would willingly form an alliance; and
they furthermore advised him to cut his grass,
which seems to prove that they were sincere in
what they said.</p>

<p>Smith now demanded a trial on the charges
which had led to his imprisonment. In spite of
objections from Wingfield a jury was granted, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Smith was acquitted of all the charges; so that on
the 10th of June he was allowed to take his seat
in the Council. On the 15th the fort was finished,
and on the 22d Captain Newport sailed for England
with a cargo of sassafras and fine wood for
wainscoting. He took the direct route homeward,
for need was now visibly pressing. He
promised to be back in Virginia within
twenty weeks, but all the food he could
leave in the fort was reckoned to be
scarcely enough for fifteen weeks, so that
the company were put upon short rations. According
to Studley, 105 persons were left at Jamestown,
of whom besides the 6 councillors, the clergyman
and the surgeon, there were mentioned by
name 29 gentlemen, 6 carpenters, 1 mason, 2
bricklayers, 1 blacksmith, 1 sailor, 1 drummer, 1
tailor, 1 barber, 12 labourers, and 4 boys, with 38
whom he neither names or classifies but simply
mentions as "divers others." The food left in
store for this company was not appetizing. After
the ship had gone, says Richard Potts, "there remained
neither tavern, beer-house, nor place of
relief but the common kettle; ... and that was
half a pint of wheat and as much barley, boiled
with water, for a man a day; and this, having
fried some 26 weeks in the ship's hold, contained
as many worms as grains.... "Our [only] drink
was water.... Had we been as free from all sins
as gluttony and drunkenness, we might have been
canonized for saints."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Chickens were raised,
but not enough for so many mouths, and as there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>were no cattle or sheep a nourishing diet of meat
and milk was out of the question. Nor
do we find much mention of game, though
there were some who warded off the
pangs of starvation by catching crabs and sturgeon
in the river. With such inadequate diet, with
unfamiliar kinds of labour, and with the frightful
heat of an American summer, the condition of the
settlers soon came to be pitiable. Disease soon
added to their sufferings. Fevers lurked in the air
of Jamestown. Before the end of September more
than fifty of the company were in their graves.
The situation is graphically described by one of
the survivors, the Hon. George Percy, brother of
the Earl of Northumberland: "There were neuer
Englishmen left in a forreigne Countrey in such
miserie as wee were in this new discouered Virginia.
Wee watched euery three nights, lying on
the bare ... ground, what weather soeuer came;
[and] warded all the next day; which brought
our men to bee most feeble wretches. Our food
was but a small Can of Barlie sodden in water to
fiue men a day. Our drink cold water taken out
of the River; which was at a floud verie
salt: at a low tide full of slime and
filth; which was the destruction of many of our
men. Thus we lived for the space of fiue months
in this miserable distresse, not hauing fiue able
men to man our Bulwarkes upon any occasion. If
it had not pleased God to haue put a terrour in
the Sauages hearts, we had all perished by those
vild and cruell Pagans, being in that weake estate
as we were; our men night and day groaning in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
every corner of the Fort most pittiful to heare. If
there were any conscience in men, it would make
their harts to bleed to heare the pitifull murmurings
and outcries of our sick men without reliefe,
euery night and day for the space of sixe weekes:
some departing out of the World, many times three
or foure in a night; in the morning their bodies
being trailed out of their Cabines like Dogges, to
be buried. In this sort did I see the mortalitie of
diuers of our people,"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Quarrels.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Wingfield deposed; Ratcliffe chosen president, Sept., 1607.</div>

<p>In such a state of things our colonists would
have been more than human had they shown very
amiable tempers. From the early wanderings of
the Spaniards in Darien down to the recent
marches of Stanley in Africa, men struggling with
the wilderness have fiercely quarrelled.
The fever at Jamestown carried off Captain
Gosnold in August, and after his death the
feud between Smith's friends and Wingfield's
flamed up with fresh virulence. Both gentlemen
have left printed statements, and in our time the
quarrel is between historians as to which to believe.
Perhaps it is Smith's detractors who are
just at this moment the more impetuous and implacable,
appealing as they do to the churlish feeling
that delights in seeing long-established reputations
assailed. Such writers will tell you as
positively as if there could be no doubt about it,
that Smith was engaged in a plot with two other
members of the Council to depose Wingfield from
his presidency and establish a "triumvirate" over
that tiny woodland company. Others will assert,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>with equal confidence, that Wingfield was a tyrant
whose ruthless rule became insupportable. A perusal
of his "Discourse of Virginia," written in 1608
in defence of his conduct, should make it clear, I
think, that he was an honourable gentleman, but
ill fitted for the trying situation in which he found
himself. To control the rations of so many hungry
men was no pleasant or easy matter. It was
charged against Wingfield that he kept back
sundry dainties, and especially some wine and
spirits for himself and a few favoured friends;
but his quite plausible defence is that he reserved
two gallons of sack for the communion table and
a few bottles of brandy for extreme emergencies,
but the other members of the Council, whose flasks
were all empty, "did long for to sup up that little
remnant!"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> At length a suspicion arose that he
intended to take one of the small vessels
that remained in the river and abandon
the colony. Early in September the
Council deposed him and elected John
Ratcliffe in his place. A few days later Wingfield
was condemned to pay heavy damages to Smith
for defaming his character. "Then Master Recorder,"
says poor Wingfield, "did very learnedly
comfort me that if I had wrong I might bring my
writ of error in London; whereat I smiled.... I
tould Master President I ... prayed they would
be more sparing of law vntill wee had more witt
or wealthe."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Execution of a member of the Council.</div>

<p>An awful dignity hedged about the sacred per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>son
of the president of that little colony of fifty
men. One day President Ratcliffe beat James
Reed, the blacksmith, who so far forgot himself as
to strike back, and for that heinous offence was
condemned to be hanged; but when
already upon the fatal ladder, and, so
to speak <i>in extremis</i>, like Reynard the
Fox, the resourceful blacksmith made his peace
with the law by revealing a horrid scheme of
mutiny conceived by George Kendall, a member
of the Council. Of the details of the affair nothing
is known save that Kendall was found guilty,
and instead of a plebeian hanging there was an
aristocratic shooting. In telling the story Wingfield
observes that if such goings-on were to be
heard of in England, "I fear it would drive many
well-affected myndes from this honourable action
of Virginia."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Smith is captured by Opekankano,</div>

<p>Wingfield's pamphlet freely admits that Smith's
activity in trading with the Indians for corn was
of great service to the suffering colony. With the
coming of autumn so many wild fowl were shot
that the diet was much improved. On the 10th of
December Smith started on an exploring expedition
up the Chickahominy River. Having gone
as far as his shallop would take him, he left seven
men to guard it while he went on in a canoe with
only two white men and two Indian guides. This
little party had arrived at White Oak Swamp, or
somewhere in that neighbourhood, when they were
suddenly attacked by 200 Indians led by Opekankano,
a brother of The Powhatan. Smith's two
comrades were killed, and he was captured after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>a sturdy resistance, but not until he had slain
two Indians with his pistol. It was quite
like the quick-witted man to take out his
ivory pocket compass, and to entertain
the childish minds of the barbarians with its quivering
needle which they could plainly see through
the glass, but, strange to say, could not feel when
they tried to touch it. Very like him it was to
improve the occasion with a brief discourse on
star craft, eked out no doubt with abundant gesticulation,
which may have led his hearers to
regard him as a wizard. There seems to have
been a difference of opinion among them. They
tied Smith to a tree, and the fate of Saint Sebastian
seemed in store for him, when Opekankano
held up the compass; then the captive was untied,
and they marched away through the forest, taking
him with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">who takes him to Werowocomoco, Jan., 1608.</div>

<p>It is not at all clear why the red men should
have made this attack. Hitherto the Powhatans
had seemed friendly to the white men and desirous
of an alliance with them. There is a vague traditional
impression that Opekankano was one of a
party opposed to such a policy; so that his attitude
might remind us of the attitude of Montezuma's
brother Cuitlahuatzin toward the army of
Cortes approaching Mexico. Such a view is not
improbable. Wingfield, moreover, tells us that
two or three years before the arrival of the English
at Jamestown some white men had ascended a
river to the northward, probably the Pamunkey or
the Rappahannock, and had forcibly kidnapped
some Indians. If there is truth in this, the kid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>nappers
may have belonged to the ill-fated expedition
of Bartholomew Gilbert. Wingfield says that
Opekankano carried Smith about the country to
several villages to see if anybody could identify
him with the leader of that kidnapping
party. Smith's narrative confirms this
statement, and adds that it was agreed
that the captain in question was a much
taller man than he. His story is full of observations
on the country. Opekankano's village consisted
of four or five communal houses, each about
a hundred feet in length, and from the sandy hill
in which it stood some scores of such houses could
be seen scattered about the plain. At length
Smith was brought to Werowocomoco and into
the presence of The Powhatan, who received him
in just such a long wigwam. The elderly chieftain
sat before the fireplace, on a kind of bench, and
was covered with a robe of raccoon skins, all with
the tails on and hanging like ornamental tassels.
Beside him sat his young squaws, a row of women
with their faces and bare shoulders painted bright
red and chains of white shell beads about their
necks stood around by the walls, and in front of
them stood the grim warriors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rescue by Pocahontas.</div>

<p>This was on the 5th of January, 1608, and on
the 8th Smith returned to Jamestown, escorted by
four Indians. What had happened to him in the
interval? In his own writings we have two different
accounts. In his tract published under the
title, "A True Relation,"&mdash;which was merely a
letter written by him in or about June, 1608, to
a "worshipful friend" in London and there pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>lished,
apparently without his knowledge, in August,&mdash;Smith
simply says that The Powhatan
treated him very courteously and sent him back
to Jamestown. But in the "General History of
Virginia," a far more elaborate and circumstantial
narrative, published in London in 1624, written
partly by Smith himself and partly by others of
the colony, we get a much fuller story. We are
told that after he had been introduced to The
Powhatan's long wigwam, as above described, the
Indians debated together and presently two big
stones were placed before the chief, and Smith
was dragged thither and his head laid
upon them; but even while warriors were
standing, with clubs in hand, to beat his
brains out, the chief's young daughter Pocahontas
rushed up and embraced him and laid her head
upon his to shield him, whereupon her father
spared his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recent attempt to discredit the story.</div>

<p>For two centuries and a half the later and
fuller version of this story was universally accepted
while the earlier and briefer was ignored.
Every schoolboy was taught the story of Pocahontas
and John Smith, and for most people I dare
say that incident is the only one in the captain's
eventful career that is remembered. But in recent
times the discrepancy between the earlier and later
accounts has attracted attention, and the conclusion
has been hastily reached that in the more
romantic version Smith is simply a liar.
It is first assumed that if the Pocahontas
incident had really occurred, we should
be sure to find it in Smith's own narrative written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
within a year after its occurrence; and then it is
assumed that in later years, when Pocahontas visited
London and was lionized as a princess, Smith
invented the story in order to magnify his own
importance by thus linking his name with hers.
By such specious logic is the braggadocio theory
of Smith's career supported, and underneath the
whole of it lies the tacit assumption that the Pocahontas
incident is an extraordinary one, something
that in an Indian community or anywhere would
not have been likely to happen.</p>

<p>As this view of the case has been set forth by
writers of high repute for scholarship, it has been
generally accepted upon their authority; in many
quarters it has become the fashionable view. Yet
its utter flimsiness can be exhibited, I think, in
very few words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Percy's pamphlet, 1625.</div>

<p>The first occasion on which Smith mentions his
rescue by Pocahontas was the occasion of her arrival
in London, in 1616, as the wife of John Rolfe.
In an eloquent letter to King James's queen,
Anne of Denmark, he bespeaks the royal favour
for the strange visitor from Virginia and extols
her good qualities and the kindness she had shown
to the colony. In the course of the letter he says
"she hazarded the beating out of her own brains
to save mine." There were then several persons
in London, besides Pocahontas herself, who could
have challenged this statement if it had been false,
but we do not find that anybody did so.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In 1624,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>when Smith published his "General History,"
with its minutely circumstantial account of the
affair, why do we not find, even on the
part of his enemies, any intimation of
the falsity of the story? Within a year
George Percy wrote a pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> for the express
purpose of picking the "General History" to
pieces and discrediting it in the eyes of the public;
he was one of the original company at Jamestown.
If Smith had not told his comrades of the
Pocahontas incident as soon as he had escaped
from The Powhatan's clutches, if he had kept silent
on the subject for years, Percy could not have
failed to know the fact and would certainly have
used it as a weapon. There were others who could
have done the same, and their silence furnishes a
very strong presumption of the truth of the story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The printed text of the "True Relation" is incomplete.</div>

<p>Why then did Smith refrain from mentioning it
in the letter to a friend in England, written in
1608, while the incidents of his captivity
were fresh in his mind? Well, we do
not know that he did refrain from mentioning
it, for we do know that the letter,
as published in August, 1608, had been tampered
with. Smith was in Virginia, and the editor in
London expressly states in his Preface that he
has omitted a portion of the manuscript: "somewhat
more was by him written, which being (as I
thought) fit to be private, I would not adventure to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>make it public." Nothing could be more explicit.
Observe that thus the case of Smith's detractors
falls at once to the ground. Their rejection of
the Pocahontas story is based upon its absence
from the printed text of the "True Relation," but
inasmuch as that printed text is avowedly incomplete
no such inference is for a moment admissible.
For the omitted portion is as likely as not
to have been the passage describing Smith's imminent
peril and rescue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason for omitting the Pocahontas incident.</div>

<p>On this supposition, what could have been the
editor's motive in suppressing the passage? We
need not go far afield for an answer if we bear in
mind the instructions with which the first colonists
started,&mdash;"to suffer no man ... to write [in]
any letter of anything that may discourage
others."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This very necessary and important
injunction may have restrained Smith himself
from mentioning his deadly peril; if he
did mention it, we can well understand
why the person who published the letter
should have thought it best to keep the matter
private. After a few years had elapsed and the
success of the colony was assured, there was no
longer any reason for such reticence. My own
opinion is that Smith, not intending the letter for
publication, told the whole story, and that the suppression
was the editor's work. It will be remembered
that in the fight in which he was captured,
Smith slew two Indians. In the circumstantial
account given in the "General History" we are
told that while Opekankano was taking him up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
down the country, a near relative of one of these
victims attempted to murder Smith but was prevented
by the Indians who were guarding him.
The "True Relation" preserves this incident,
while it omits all reference to the two occasions
when Smith's life was officially and deliberately
imperilled, the tying to the tree and the scene in
The Powhatan's wigwam. One can easily see
why the editor's nerves should not have been disturbed
by the first incident, so like what might
happen in England, while the more strange and
outlandish exhibitions of the Indian's treatment
of captives seemed best to be dropped from the
narrative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">There is no incongruity between the two narratives, except the omission.</div>

<p>But, we are told, the difficulty is not merely one
of omission. In the "True Relation" Smith not
only omits all reference to Pocahontas,
but he says that he was kindly and courteously
treated by his captors, and this
statement is thought to be incompatible
with their having decided to beat his
brains out. Such an objection shows ignorance
of Indian manners. In our own time it has been
a common thing for Apaches and Comanches to
offer their choicest morsels of food, with their
politest bows and smiles, to the doomed captive
whose living flesh will in a few moments be hissing
under their firebrands. The irony of such a
situation is inexpressibly dear to the ferocious
hearts of these men of the Stone Age, and American
history abounds in examples of it. In his
fuller account, indeed, Smith describes himself as
kindly treated on his way to the scene of execution<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>and after his rescue. Drop out what happened
in the interval and you get the account
given in the "True Relation."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The account in the "General History" is the more probable.</div>

<p>Now that omission creates a gap in the "True
Relation" such as to fatally damage its credibility.
We are told that Smith, after
killing a couple of Indians, is taken captive
and carried to the head war-chief's
wigwam, and is then forsooth allowed to
go scot free with no notice taken of the blood debt
that he owes to the tribe! To any one who has
studied Indians such a story is well-nigh incredible.
As a prisoner of war Smith's life was
already forfeited.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> It is safe to say that no Indian
would think of releasing him without some
equivalent; such an act might incur the wrath of
invisible powers. There were various ways of
putting captives to death; torture by slow fire
was the favourite mode, but crushing in the skull
with tomahawks was quite common, so that when
Smith mentions it as decided upon in his case he
is evidently telling the plain truth, and we begin
to see that the detailed account in the "General
History" is more consistent and probable than
the abridged account in the "True Relation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The rescue was in strict accordance with Indian usage.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Adoption of Smith.</div>

<p>The consistency and probability of the story are
made complete by the rescue at the hands of
Pocahontas. That incident is precisely in accordance
with Indian usage, but it is not likely that
Smith knew enough about such usage to have invented
it, and his artless way of telling the story
is that of a man who is describing what he does
not understand. From the Indian point of view
there was nothing romantic or extraordinary in
such a rescue; it was simply a not uncommon
matter of business. The romance
with which white readers have
always invested it is the outcome of a
misconception no less complete than that which
led the fair dames of London to make obeisance
to the tawny Pocahontas as to a princess of imperial
lineage. Time and again it used to happen
that when a prisoner was about to be slaughtered,
some one of the dusky assemblage, moved by pity
or admiration or some unexplained freak, would
interpose in behalf of the victim; and as a rule
such interposition was heeded. Many a poor
wretch, already tied to the fatal tree and benumbed
with unspeakable terror, while the firebrands
were heating for his torment, has been
rescued from the jaws of death, and adopted as
brother or lover by some laughing young squaw, or
as a son by some grave wrinkled warrior. In such
cases the new-comer was allowed entire freedom
and treated like one of the tribe. As the blood
debt was cancelled by the prisoner's violent death,
it was also cancelled by securing his services to
the tribe; and any member, old or young, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
a right to demand the latter method as a substitute
for the former. Pocahontas, therefore, did
not "hazard the beating out of her own brains,"
though the rescued stranger, looking with civilized
eyes, would naturally see it in that light. Her
brains were perfectly safe. This thirteen-year-old
squaw liked the handsome prisoner, claimed him,
and got him, according to custom. Mark now
what happened next. Two days afterward The
Powhatan, "having disguised himselfe in the most
fearfullest manner he could, caused Captain Smith
to be brought forth to a great house in the woods,
and there vpon a mat by the fire be left alone.
Not long after frome behind a mat that divided
the house [<i>i. e.</i> a curtain] was made the most
dolefullest noyse he ever heard."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Then the old
chieftain, looking more like the devil than a man,
came to Smith and told him that now they were
friends and he might go back to Jamestown;
then if he would send to The Powhatan a couple
of cannon and a grindstone, he should
have in exchange a piece of land in the
neighbourhood, and that chief would evermore
esteem him as his own son. Smith's narrative
does not indicate that he understood this to be
anything more than a friendly figure of speech,
but it seems clear that it was a case of ceremonious
adoption. As the natural result of the young
girl's intercession the white chieftain was adopted
into the tribe. A long incantation, with dismal
howls and grunts, propitiated the tutelar deities,
and then the old chief, addressing Smith as a son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
proposed an exchange of gifts. The next time
that Smith visited Werowocomoco, The Powhatan
proclaimed him a "werowance" or chief of the
tribe, and ordered "that all his subjects should so
esteem us, and no man account us strangers ...
but Powhatans, and that the corn, women, and
country should be to us as to his own people."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of the story of Pocahontas.</div>

<p>I have dwelt at some length upon the question
of Smith's veracity for three good reasons. First,
in the interests of sound historical criticism,
it is desirable to show how skepticism,
which is commonly supposed to
indicate superior sagacity, is quite as likely to
result from imperfect understanding. Secondly,
justice should be done to the memory of one of the
noblest and most lovable characters in American
history. Thirdly, the rescue of Smith by Pocahontas
was an event of real historic importance.
Without it the subsequent relations of the Indian
girl with the English colony become incomprehensible.
But for her friendly services on more
than one occasion, the tiny settlement would
probably have perished. Her visits to Jamestown
and the regular supply of provisions by the Indians
began at this time.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of the First Supply, Jan. 8, 1608.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ratcliffe deposed; Smith chosen president, Sept., 1608; arrival of the Second Supply.</div>

<p>On the very day that Smith returned to Jamestown
the long expected ship of Captain Newport
arrived with what was known as the First
Supply of men and provisions. Part
came now, the rest a few weeks later.
Only 38 men had survived the hardships at Jamestown;
to these the First Supply added 120, bringing
the number up to 158. For so many people,
besides the food they brought with them more corn
was needed. So Smith took his "Father Newport,"
as he called him, over to Werowocomoco,
where they tickled "Father Powhatan's" fancy
with blue glass beads and drove some tremendous
bargains. As spring came on, Newport sailed for
England again, taking with him the deposed
Wingfield. The summer of 1608 was spent by
Smith in two voyages of exploration up Chesapeake
Bay and into the Potomac, Patapsco, and
Susquehanna rivers. He met with warriors of the
formidable Iroquois tribe of Susquehannocks, and
found them carrying a few French hatchets which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>had evidently come from Canada. During his
absence things went badly at Jamestown
and Ratcliffe was deposed. On Smith's
return in September he was at once
chosen president. Only 28 men had been
lost this year, so that the colony numbered
130, when Newport again arrived in September,
with the Second Supply of 70 persons,
bringing the total up to 200. In this company
there were two women, a Mrs. Forrest and her
maid, Anne Burroughs, who was soon married to
John Laydon, the first recorded English wedding
on American soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Captain Newport's instructions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Coronation of The Powhatan.</div>

<p>Newport's instructions show that the members
of the London Company, sitting at their cosy English
firesides, were getting impatient and
meant to have something done. He was
told that he must find either the way
to the South Sea, or a lump of gold, or one of
White's lost colonists, or else he need not come
back and show his face in England! One seems
taken back to the Arabian Nights, where such
peremptory behests go along with enchanted carpets
and magic rings and heroic steeds with pegs
in the neck. No such talismans were to be found
in Old Virginia. When Newport read his instructions,
Smith bluntly declared that the London
Company were fools, which seems to have shocked
the decorous mariner. The next order was grotesque
enough to have emanated from the teeming
brain of James I. after a mickle noggin of
his native Glenlivat. Their new ally, the mighty
Emperor Powhatan, must be crowned! Newport
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>and Smith did it, and much mirth it must have
afforded them. The chief refused to come to
Jamestown, so Mahomet had to go to the mountain.
Up in the long wigwam at Werowocomoco
the two Englishmen divested
the old fellow of his raccoon-skin<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> garment
and put on him a scarlet robe which greatly
pleased him. Then they tried to force him down
upon his knees&mdash;which he did not like at all&mdash;while
they put the crown on his head. When
the operation was safely ended, the forest-monarch
grunted acquiescence and handed to Newport his
old raccoon-skin cloak as a present for his royal
brother in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the Indian girls danced at Werowocomoco.</div>

<p>An Indian masquerading scene at one of these
visits to Werowocomoco is thus described by one
of the English party: "In a fayre playne field
they made a fire, before which [we] sitting upon
a mat, suddainly amongst the woods was heard ... a
hydeous noise and shrieking.... Then
presently [we] were presented with this anticke;
thirtie young women came [nearly] naked
out of the woods, ... their bodies
all painted, some white, some red, some
black, some particolour, but all differing;
their leader had a fayre payre of buck's horns on
her head, and an otter's skin at her girdle, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>other
at her arm, a quiver of arrowes at her back,
a bow and arrowes in her hand; the next had in
her hand a sword, another a club, ... all horned
alike.... These fiends with most hellish shouts
and cries, rushing from among the trees, cast
themselves in a ring about the fire, singing and
dauncing with most excellent ill varietie; ... having
spent neare an houre in this mascarado, as
they entred in like manner they departed. Having
reaccommodated themselves, they solemnly invited
[us] to their lodgings, where [we] were no sooner
within the house but all these nymphes more tormented
us than ever, with crowding, pressing, and
hanging about [us], most tediously crying, <i>Love
you not me?</i> This salutation ended, the feast was
set, consisting of fruit in baskets, fish and flesh in
wooden platters; beans and peas there wanted
not, nor any salvage dainty their invention could
devise: some attending, others singing and dancing
about [us]; which mirth and banquet being
ended, with firebrands [for] torches they conducted
[us] to [our] lodging."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accuracy of Smith's descriptions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Todkill's complaint.</div>

<p>The wood-nymphs who thus entertained their
guests are in one account mentioned simply as
"Powhatan's women," in another they are spoken
of as "Pocahontas and her women;" which seems
to give us a realistic sketch of the little maid with
her stag-horn headdress and skin all stained with
puccoon leading her companions in their
grotesque capers. Truly, it was into a
strange world and among a strange people
that our colonists had come. Their quaint descriptions
of manners and customs utterly new and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
unintelligible to them, though familiar enough to
modern students of barbaric life, have always the
ring of truth. Nowhere in the later experiences of
white men with Indians do we find quite so powerful
a charm as in the early years of the seventeenth
century. No other such narratives are quite
so delightful as those of Champlain and his friends
in Canada, and those of Smith and his comrades
in Virginia. There is a freshness about this first
contact with the wilderness and its uncouth life
that makes every incident vivid. There is a fascination
too, not unmixed with sadness, in watching
the early dreams of El Dorado fade away as
the stern reality of a New World to be conquered
comes to make itself known and felt. Naturally
the old delusions persisted at home in England
long after the colonists had been taught by costly
experiences to discard them, and we smile at the
well-meant blundering of the ruling powers in London
in their efforts to hasten the success of their
enterprise. In vain did the faithful Newport seek
to perform the mandates of the London Company.
No nuggets of gold were to be found, nor traces of
poor Eleanor Dare and her friends, and The Powhatan
told the simple truth when he declared that
there were difficult mountains westward and it
would be useless to search for a salt sea behind
them. Newport tried, nevertheless, but came back
exhausted long before he had reached the Blue
Ridge; for what foe is so pertinacious as a strange
and savage continent? In pithy terms does Anas
Todkill, one of the first colonists, express himself
about these wild projects: "Now was there no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>way to make us miserable but to neglect that time
to make our provision whilst it was to be had;
the which was done to perfourme this strange discovery,
but more strange coronation. To lose that
time, spend that victuall we had, tire and starue
our men, having no means to carry victuall, munition,
the hurt or sicke, but their own backes: how
or by whom they were invented I know not."
How eloquent in grief and indignation are these
rugged phrases! A modern writer, an accomplished
Oxford scholar, expresses the opinion that
the coronation of The Powhatan, although "an
idle piece of formality," "had at least the merit of
winning and retaining the loyalty of the savage."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Master Todkill thought differently: "as
for the coronation of Powhatan and his
presents of bason, ewer, bed, clothes, and such
costly nouelties; they had bin much better well
spared than so ill spent; for we had his favour
much better onlie for a poore peece of copper, till
this stately kinde of soliciting made him so much
overvalue himselfe, that he respected vs as much
as nothing at all."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Smith's map of Virginia.</div>

<p>When Newport sailed for England, he took with
him Ratcliffe, the deposed president, a man of
doubtful character of whom it was said that he had
reasons for using an alias, his real name being
Sickelmore. Deposed presidents were liable to
serve as tale-bearers and mischief-makers. Wingfield
had gone home on the previous voyage, and
Newport had brought back to Virginia complaints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>from the Company about the way in which things
had been managed. Now Smith sent to London
by Newport his new map of Virginia embodying
the results of his recent voyages
of exploration, a map of remarkable accuracy and
witness to an amount of original labour that is
marvellous to think of. That map is a living refutation
of John Smith's detractors; none but a man
of heroic mould could have done the geographical
work involved in making it.</p>

<p>With the map Smith sent what he naïvely calls
his "Rude Answer" to the London Company, a
paper bristling with common-sense and not timid
when it comes to calling a spade a spade. With
some topics suggested by this "Rude Answer" we
shall concern ourselves in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="c">THE STARVING TIME.</p>


<div class="sidenote">The name of Christopher.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Value of the Indian alliance.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> men of bygone days were quite as fond as
ourselves of playing with names, and the name
of Christopher, or "Christ-bearer," was a favourite
subject for such pastime. The old Syrian saint
and martyr was said to have forded a river carrying
Christ on his back in the form of a child;
and so when in the year 1500 Columbus's famous
pilot, Juan de La Cosa, made his map of the new
discoveries, and came to a place where he did not
know how to draw his coast-line, he filled
the space with a picture of the new Christopher
wading in mid-ocean and bringing
over Christ to the heathen. At the court
of James I. it was fashionable to make similar
mild jests upon the name of Captain Christopher
Newport, whose ships were carrying year by year
the gospel to the tawny natives of Virginia. Very
little of the good tidings, however, had the poor
heathen of Pamunkey and Werowocomoco as yet
received. So much ado had the English colonists
to keep their own souls from quitting their bodies
that they had little leisure to bestow upon the spiritual
welfare of the Indians. By the accident of
Smith's capture and the intercession of Pocahontas,
they had effected a kind of alliance with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>most powerful tribe in that part of the country,
and this alliance had proved extremely valuable
throughout the year 1608; without it
the little colony might have perished before
the arrival of the Second Supply.
Nevertheless the friendship of the red men was a
very uncertain and precarious factor in the situation.
The accounts of the Englishmen show confused
ideas as to the relations between the tribes
and chieftains of the region; and as for the Indians,
their acquaintanceship with white men was
so recent that there was no telling what unforeseen
circumstance might at any time determine
their actions. The utmost sagacity was needed to
retain the slight influence already acquired over
them, while to alienate them might easily prove
fatal. The colony was far from able to support
itself, and as things were going there seemed little
hope of improvement. The difficulties involved
in the founding of colonies were not well understood,
and the attempts to cope with them were
unintelligent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gentlemen as pioneers.</div>

<p>In the lists of these earliest parties of settlers one
cannot fail to notice the preponderance of those
who are styled gentlemen, an epithet which in those
days was not lavishly and indiscriminately but
charily and precisely applied. As a rule the persons
designated as gentlemen were not accustomed
to manual labour. To meet the requirements of
these aristocratic members of the community, we
find in one of the lists the name of a dealer in perfumes.
A few score of farmers, with abundance
of live-stock, would have been far more to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>purpose. Yet let us do justice to the gentlemen.
One of the first company of settlers, the
sturdy soldier Anas Todkill, thus testifies
to their good spirit and efficiency: "Thirty
of us [President Smith] conducted 5 myles from
the fort, to learn to ... cut down trees and make
clapboard.... Amongst the rest he had chosen
Gabriel Beadell and John Russell, the only two
gallants of this last supply [he means October,
1608] and both proper gentlemen. Strange were
these pleasures to their conditions; yet lodging,
eating and drinking, working or playing, they
[were] but doing as the President did himselfe.
All these things were carried on so pleasantly as
within a week they became masters; making it
their delight to heare the trees thunder as they
fell; but the axes so oft blistered their tender fingers
that many times every third blow had a loud
othe to drowne the eccho; for remedie of which
sinne, the President devised how to have every
man's othes numbred, and at night for every othe
to have a cann of water powred downe his sleeue,
with which every offender was so washed (himselfe
and all) that a man should scarce hear an othe in
a weeke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="smaller">For he who scorns and makes but jests of cursings and his othe,<br />
He doth contemne, not man but God; nor God, nor man, but both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this let no man thinke that the President and
these gentlemen spent their time as common woodhackers
at felling of trees, or such other like labours;
or that they were pressed to it as hirelings
or common slaues; for what they did, after they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
were but once a little invred, it seemed and some
conceited it only as a pleasure and recreation: ...
30 or 40 of such voluntary gentlemen would doe
more in a day than 100 of the rest that must be
prest to it by compulsion." Nevertheless, adds
this ingenuous writer, "twentie good workmen had
been better than them all."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">All is not gold that glitters.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Glass and soap.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Disappointment of the Company.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Tale-bearers and complaints.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Smith's "Rude Answer."</div>

<p>One strong motive which drew many of these
gentlemen to the New World, like the Castilian
hidalgos of a century before, was doubtless the
mere love of wild adventure. Another motive was
the quest of the pearls and gold about
gold that which the poet Drayton had written. In
the spring of 1608, while Newport was
on the scene with his First Supply, somebody discovered
a bank of bright yellow dirt, and its
colour was thought to be due to particles of gold.
Then there was clatter and bustle; "there was no
thought, no discourse, no hope, and no work but
to dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, and load gold."
In the list of the First Supply we find the names
of two goldsmiths, two refiners, and one jeweller;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
but such skill as these artisans had was of little
avail, for Newport carried a shipload of the yellow
stuff to London, and found, to his chagrin, that
all is not gold that glitters. On that same voyage
he carried home a coop of plump turkeys, the first
that ever graced an English bill of fare. Smith
seems early to have recovered from the gold fever,
and to have tried his hand at various industries.
If precious metals could not be found, there was
plenty of excellent timber at hand. The produc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>tion
of tar and soap was also attempted, as well
as the manufacture of glass, to assist in
which eight Germans and Poles were
brought over in the Second Supply. It was hardly
to be expected that such industries should attain
remunerative proportions in the hands of a little
company of settlers who were still confronted with
the primitive difficulty of getting food enough to
keep themselves alive. The arrival of reinforcements
was far from being an unmixed benefit.
Each new supply brought many new mouths to be
filled, while by the time the ship was ready to sail
for England, leaving all the provisions it could
safely spare, the remnant was so small that the
gaunt spectre of threatening famine was never
quite out of sight. Moreover the new-comers from
the civilized world arrived with their heads full of
such wild notions as the older settlers were beginning
to recover from under the sharp lessons of
experience; thus was confusion again and again
renewed. While the bitter tale was being enacted
in the wilderness, people in London were wondering
why the symptoms of millennial happiness
were so slow in coming from this Virginian paradise.
From the golden skewers and dripping-pans
adorning the kitchens of barbaric potentates,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> or
the priceless pearls that children strolling on the
beach could fill their aprons with, the descent
to a few shiploads of ignoble rough
boards and sassafras was truly humiliating.
No wonder that the Company should have
been loth to allow tales of personal peril in Vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>ginia
to find their way into print. No wonder
that its directors should have looked with rueful
faces at the long columns of outgoes compared with
the scant and petty entries on the credit side of
the ledger. No wonder if they should have arrived
at a state of impatience like that of the urchin
who has planted a bed full of seed and cannot be
restrained from digging them up to see what they
are coming to. At such times there is sure to be
plenty of fault-finding; disappointment seeks a
vent in scolding. We have observed that Wingfield,
the deposed president, had returned to England
early in 1608; with him went Captain Gabriel
Archer, formerly a student of law at Gray's Inn,
and one of the earliest members of the legal
profession in English America. His name is commemorated
in the little promontory near Jamestown
called Archer's Hope. He was a mischief-maker
of whom Wingfield in his "Discourse of
Virginia" speaks far more bitterly than of Smith.
To the latter Archer was an implacable enemy.
On the return of Smith from his brief captivity
with the Indians, this crooked Archer exhibited
his legal ingenuity in seeking to revive a provision
in the laws of Moses that a captain who leads his
men into a fatal situation is responsible for their
death. By such logic Smith would be
responsible for the deaths of his followers
slain, by Opekankano's Indians; therefore,
said Archer, he ought to be executed for murder!
President Ratcliffe, alias Sickelmore, appears
to have been a mere tool in Archer's hands, and
Smith's life may really have been in some danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>when Newport's arrival discomfited his adversaries.
One can see what kind of tales such an unscrupulous
enemy would be likely to tell in London, and
it was to be expected that Newport, on arriving
with his Second Supply, would bring some message
that Smith would regard as unjust. The
nature of the message is reflected in the reply
which Smith sent home by Newport in November,
1608. The wrath of the much-enduring man
was thoroughly aroused; in his "Rude
Answer," as he calls it, he strikes out
from the shoulder, and does not even
spare his friend Newport for bringing such messages.
Thus does he address the Royal Council
of Virginia, sitting in London: "Right Honourable
Lords and Gentlemen: I received your letter
wherein you write that our minds are so set upon
faction and idle conceits, ... and that we feed
you but with ifs and ands, hopes, and some few
proofes; as if we would keep the mystery of the
businesse to ourselues; and that we must expresly
follow your instructions sent by Captain Newport,
the charge of whose voyage amounts to neare
£2000 the which if we cannot defray by the ship's
returne, we are like to remain as banished men.
To these particulars I humbly intreat your pardons
if I offend you with my rude answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I cannot prevent quarrels.</div>

<p>"For our factions, vnlesse you would haue me
run away and leaue the country, I cannot
prevent them: ... I do make many
stay that would els fly anywhither....
[As to feeding] you with hopes, etc., though I
be no scholar, I am past a school-boy; and I desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
but to know what either you [or] these here do
know but I have learned to tell you by the continual
hazard of my life. I have not concealed
from you anything I know; but I feare some
cause you to believe much more than is true.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Your instructions were not wise.</div>

<p>"Expressly to follow your directions by Captain
Newport, though they be performed, I was directly
against it; but according to our Commission,
I was content to be ruled by the
major part of the council, I fear to the
hazard of us all; which now is generally confessed
when it is too late.... I have crowned Powhatan
according to your instructions. For the charge
of this voyage of £2000 we have not received the
value of £100.... For him at that time to find
... the South Sea, [or] a mine of gold, or any
of them sent by Sir Walter Raleigh: at our consultation
I told them was as likely as the rest.
But during this great discovery of thirty miles
(which might as well have been done by one man,
and much more, for the value of a pound of copper
at a seasonable time) they had the pinnace and all
the boats with them [save] one that remained with
me to serve the fort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From our infant industries you must not expect too much.</div>

<p>"In their absence I followed the new begun
works of pitch and tar, glass, soap ashes, and clapboard;
whereof some small quantities we
have sent you. But if you rightly consider
what an infinite toil it is in Russia
and Swedeland, where the woods are
proper for naught else, and though there be the
help both of man and beast in those ancient commonweals
which many an hundred years have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
[been] used [to] it; yet thousands of those poor
people can scarce get necessaries to live but from
hand to mouth. And though your factors there
can buy as much in a week as will fraught you a
ship ...; you must not expect from us any such
matter, which are but a many of ignorant miserable
souls, that are scarce able to get wherewith to
live and defend ourselves against the inconstant
salvages; finding but here and there a tree fit for
the purpose, and want[ing] all things else [which]
the Russians have.</p>

<div class="sidenote">While we suffer for want of food,</div>

<p>"For the coronation of Powhatan, by whose
advice you sent him such presents I know not;
but this give me leave to tell you, I fear
they will be the confusion of us all ere
we hear from you again. At your ship's
arrival the salvages's harvest was newly gathered
and we [were] going to buy it; our own not being
half sufficient for so great a number. As for the
two [shiploads] of corn [which] Newport promised
to provide us from Powhatan,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> he brought us
but 14 bushels ... [while most of his men were]
sick and near famished. From your ship we had
not provision in victuals worth £20, and we are
more than 200 to live upon this; the one half sick,
the other little better.... Our diet is a little
meal and water, and not sufficient of that. Though
there be fish in the sea, fowls in the air, and beasts
in the woods, their bounds are so large, they so
wild, and we so weak and ignorant that we cannot
much trouble them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">peculation and intrigue are rife.</div>

<p>"The soldiers say many of your officers maintain
their families out of that you send us; and
that Newport hath £100 a year for carrying
news.... Captain Ratcliffe is now
called Sickelmore, a poor counterfeited
imposture. I have sent you him home, lest the
company [here] should cut his throat. What he
is now, every one can tell you. If he and Archer
return again, they are sufficient to keep us always
in factions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Send us next time some useful workmen.</div>

<p>"When you send again I intreat you [to] send
but 30 carpenters, husbandmen, gardeners, fishermen,
blacksmiths, masons, and diggers
up of trees' roots, well provided, [rather]
than 1000 of such as we have; for except
we be able both to lodge them and feed them, the
most will consume with want of necessaries before
they can be made good for anything.... And
I humbly entreat you hereafter, let us know what
we [are to] receive, and not stand to the sailors's
courtesy to leave us what they please....</p>

<p>"These are the causes that have kept us in Virginia
from laying such a foundation [as] ere this
might have given much better content and satisfaction;
but as yet you must not look for any
profitable returns; so I humbly rest."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A sensible letter.</div>

<p>It is to be hoped that the insinuation that some
of the Company's officers were peculators was ill
founded; as for the fling at Newport, it
was evidently made in a little fit of petulance
and is inconsistent with the esteem in which
Smith really held that worthy mariner. These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
slight blemishes in a temperate, courageous, and
manly letter. It is full of hard common-sense and
tells such plain truths as must have set the Company
thinking. It was becoming evident to many
persons in London that some new departure must
be made. But before Newport's home-bound ship
could cross the ocean, and before the Company
could decide upon its new plan of operations, some
months must needs elapse, and in the interim we
will continue to follow the fortunes of the little
colony, now left to itself in the wilderness for the
third time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard Hakluyt on the Indian character.</div>

<p>It is evident from Smith's letter that he anticipated
trouble from the Indians. In The Powhatan's
promise to count him forever as his own
son he put little faith. His own view of the noble
savage seems to have been much the same as that
expressed about this time by Rev. Richard Hakluyt,
in a letter of advice and warning to the London
Company: "But for all their fair
and cunning speeches, [these natives]
are not overmuch to be trusted; for they
be the greatest traitors of the world, as their manifold
most crafty contrived and bloody treasons
... do evidently prove. They be also as unconstant
as the weathercock, and most ready to take
all occasions of advantages to do mischief. They
are great liars and dissemblers; for which faults
oftentimes they had their deserved payments....
To handle them gently, while gentle courses may

<div class="sidenote">What Smith dreaded.</div>

<div class="sidenote">How the red men's views of the situation were changed.</div>

<p>There is something delicious in the naïve promptness
with which this worthy clergyman admits the
probable need of prescribing military measures as
a preparation for the cure of souls. The London
Company may have stood in need of such advice;
Smith did not. He looked upon Indians already
with the eyes of a frontiersman, and the rough
vicissitudes of his life had made him quick to
interpret signs of mischief. It was not
so much a direct assault that he feared
as a contest arising from the Indians' refusal to
sell their corn. During the past winter Pocahontas
had made frequent and regular visits to
Jamestown, bringing corn and occasionally venison,
raccoons, and other game; and this aid had
been so effective as to ward off famine for that
season. But a change had come over her father
and his councillors. As the English kept strengthening
their fortifications and building houses, as
the second and third shiploads of colonists arrived,
the Indians must have begun to realize that it was
their intention to stay in the country. On Smith's
first visit to Werowocomoco, when The Powhatan
said that he should henceforth regard him as a
son, he showed himself extremely curious to know
why the English had come to his part of the
world. Smith did not think it safe to confess that
they had come to stay; so he invented a story of
their having been defeated by the Spaniards and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
driven ashore; then, he added, the pinnace being
leaky, they were obliged to stay until
their Father Newport should come back
and get them and take them away. Since
that conversation Father Newport had
come twice, and each time he had brought many
of his children and taken away but few. Instead
of 38 men at Jamestown there were now 200.
Every painted and feathered warrior knew that
these pale children were not good farmers, and
that their lives depended upon a supply of corn.
By withholding this necessary of life, how easy it
might be to rid the land of their presence!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A bold resolve.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage to Werowocomoco.</div>

<p>As the snows began to come, toward Christmas
of 1608, Smith's fears began to be realized.
When the Indians were asked for corn they refused
with a doggedness that withstood even the
potent fascination of blue glass beads. Smith
fully comprehended the seriousness of the situation.
"No persuasion," he says, "could persuade
him to starve." If the Indians would
not trade of their own free will they
must be made to trade. The Powhatan asked for
some men who could aid him in building a house,
and Smith sent to Werowocomoco fourteen men,
including four of the newly arrived Germans.
Smith followed with twenty-seven men in the pinnace
and barge. In the party were George Percy
and Francis West, brother of the Lord Delaware
of whom we shall have soon to speak. At Warrasqueak
Bay, where they stopped the first night,
a chieftain told them to beware of treachery at
Werowocomoco; The Powhatan, he said, had con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>cocted
a scheme for cutting their throats. Captain
Smith thanked the redskin for his good counsel,
assured him of his undying affection, and
proceeded down the river to Hampton,
where he was very hospitably entertained
by the Kecoughtans, a small tribe numbering
about twenty warriors. For about a week,
from December 30, 1608, till January 6, 1609,
a fierce blizzard of snow and sleet obliged the
party to stay in the dry and well-warmed wigwams
of the Kecoughtans, who regaled them with
oysters, fish, venison, and wild fowl. As they
passed around to the northern side of the peninsula
and approached the York River, the Indians
seemed less friendly. When they arrived at Werowocomoco
the river was frozen for nearly half
a mile from the shore, but Smith rammed and
broke the ice with his barge until he had pushed
up to a place where it was thick enough to walk
safely; then sending the barge back to the pinnace
the whole party were landed by instalments.
They quartered themselves in the first house they
came to, and sent to The Powhatan for food. He
sent them venison, turkeys, and corn-bread.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Smith's parley with The Powhatan.</div>

<p>The next day, January 13, the wily barbarian
came to see Smith and asked him bluntly how soon
he was going away. He had not asked the English,
he said, to come and visit him, and he was
sure he had no corn for them, nevertheless he
thought he knew where he could get forty baskets
of it for one good English sword per basket.
Hearing this speech, Captain Smith pointed to the
new house already begun, and to the men whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>he had sent to build it, and said, "Powhatan, I
am surprised to hear you say that you have not invited
us hither; you must have a short memory!"
At this retort the old chieftain burst into fits of
laughter, but when he had recovered gravity it
appeared that his notions as to a bargain remained
unchanged. He would sell his corn for
swords and guns, but not for copper; he could
eat corn, he could not eat copper. Then said Captain
Smith, "Powhatan, ... to testify
my love [for you] I sent you my men
for your building, neglecting mine own.
What your people had, you have engrossed, forbidding
them our trade; and now you think by
consuming the time we shall consume for want,
not having [wherewith] to fulfill your strange demands.
As for swords and guns, I told you long
ago I had none to spare.... You must know
[that the weapons] I have can keep me from
want; yet steal or wrong you I will not, nor dissolve
that friendship we have mutually promised,
except you constrain me by ... bad usage."
This covert threat was not lost upon the keen barbarian.
He quickly replied that within two days
the English should have all the corn he could
spare, but said he, "I have some doubt, Captain
Smith, [about] your coming hither, [which]
makes me not so kindly seek to relieve you as I
would. For many do inform me [that] your
coming hither is not for trade, but to invade my
people and possess my country. [They] dare not
come to bring you corn, seeing you thus armed
with your men. To free us of this fear, leave your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
weapons aboard [the ship], for here they are needless,
we being all friends, and forever <i>Powhatans</i>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A game of bluff.</div>

<p>This last remark, that Smith's men were virtually
or constructively members of the Powhatan
tribe is in harmony with my suggestion that the
rescue of their leader by Pocahontas a year before
had directly led to his adoption, according to the
usual Indian custom in such cases of rescue.
With many such discourses, says our chronicle,
did they spend the day; and on the morrow the
parley was renewed. Again and again the old
chief insisted that before the corn could be
brought, the visitors must leave their arms on
shipboard; but Smith was not so blind as to walk
into such a trap. He said, "Powhatan, ... the
vow I made you of my love, both myself and my
men have kept. As for your promise, I find it
every day violated by some of your subjects; yet
... for your sake only we have curbed our thirsting
desire of revenge; else had they known as well
the cruelty we use to our enemies as our true love
and courtesy to our friends. And I think your
judgment sufficient to conceive&mdash;as well by the
adventures we have undertaken as by the advantage
we have [in] our arms [over] yours&mdash;that
had we intended you any hurt, we could long ere
this have effected it. Your people coming to
Jamestown are entertained with their bows and
arrows, without any exceptions; we esteeming it
with you as it is with us, to wear our arms as our
apparel." Having made this hit, the captain
assumed a still loftier tone. It
would never do to admit that this blessed corn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
though the cause of so much parley, was an indispensable
necessity for the white men. "As for
your hiding your provisions ... we shall not so
unadvisedly starve as you conclude; your friendly
care in that behalf is needless, for we have [ways
of finding food that are quite] beyond your knowledge."</p>

<p>The narrative which I am here following<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> is
written by William Phettiplace, captain of the pinnace,
Jeffrey Abbot, described as sergeant, and two
of the original settlers, Anas Todkill and Richard
Wiffin. Abbot and Phettiplace were on the spot,
and the narrative was revised by Captain Smith
himself, so that it has the highest kind of authority.
One need but examine the similar parleys
described so frequently by Francis Parkman, to
realize the faithful accuracy with which these Englishmen
portrayed the Indian at that early period
when English experience of the red man's ways
was only beginning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The corn is brought.</div>

<p>The hint that perhaps white men could get
along without his corn after all seems to have
wrought its effect upon the crafty Powhatan.
Baskets filled with the yellow grain were
brought, and dickering as distinguished
from diplomacy began. Yet diplomacy had not
quite given up its game. With a sorrowful face
and many sighs the chief exclaimed: "Captain
Smith, I never used any chief so kindly as yourself,
yet from you I receive the least kindness of
any. Captain Newport gave me swords, copper,
clothes, a bed, towels, or what[ever] I desired;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
ever taking what I offered him, and would send
away his guns when I entreated him. None doth
... refuse to do what I desire but only you; of
whom I can have nothing but what you regard
not, and yet you will have whatsoever you demand....
You call me father, but I see ...
you will do what you list.... But if you intend
so friendly as you say, send hence your arms that
I may believe you."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspicions of treachery.</div>

<p>Smith felt sure that this whimpering speech was
merely the cover for a meditated attack. Of his
thirty-eight Englishmen but eighteen were with
him at the moment. He sent a messenger to his
vessels, ordering all save a guard of three or four
men to come ashore, and he set some Indians to
work breaking the ice, so that the barge
could be forced up near to the bank.
For a little while Captain Smith and
John Russell were left alone in a house with The
Powhatan and a few squaws, when all at once the
old chief slipped out and disappeared from view.
While Smith was talking with the women a crowd
of armed warriors surrounded the house, but instantly
Smith and Russell sprang forth and with
drawn swords charged upon them so furiously that
they all turned and fled, tumbling over one another
in their headlong terror.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A wily speaker.</div>

<p>This incident gave the Englishmen a moral advantage.
The Indian plot, if such it was, had
failed, and now the red men "to the uttermost of
their skill sought excuses to dissemble the matter;
and Powhatan, to excuse his flight and the sudden
coming of this multitude, sent our Captain a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>bracelet and a chain of pearl,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> by an ancient orator
that bespoke us to this purpose; perceiving even
then from our pinnace, a barge and men departing
and coming unto us:&mdash;Captain Smith,
our [chief] is fled; fearing your guns,
and knowing when the ice was broken there would
come more men, sent these numbers but to guard
his corn from stealing, [which] might happen without
your knowledge. Now, though some be hurt
by your misprision, yet [The] Powhatan is your
friend, and so will forever continue. Now since
the ice is open he would have you send away your
corn, and if you would have his company send
away also your guns." It was ingeniously if not
ingenuously said, but the concluding request remained
unheeded, and Smith never set eyes on his
Father Powhatan again. With faces frowning,
guns loaded and cocked, the Englishmen stood by
while a file of Indians with baskets on their backs
carried down the corn and loaded it into the
barge. The Indians were glad to get safely done
with such work; as the chronicle observes, "we
needed not importune them to make despatch."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pocahontas reveals the plot.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Smith's message to The Powhatan.</div>

<p>The Englishmen would at once have embarked,
but the retreating tide had left the barge stranded,
so that it was necessary to wait for the next high
water. Accordingly it was decided to pass the
night in the house where they were already quartered,
which was a kind of outpost at some distance
from the main village, and they sent word to
The Powhatan to send them some supper. Then
the Indians seem to have debated the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>whether it would be prudent to surprise and slay
them while at supper or afterward while asleep.
But that "dearest jewel," Pocahontas, says the
narrative, "in that dark night came through the
irksome woods, and told our Captain
great cheer should be sent us by and by;
but Powhatan and all the power he could
make would after[ward] come kill us all, if [indeed]
they that brought it [did] not kill us ... when
we were at supper. Therefore if we would
live she wished us presently to be gone. Such
things as she delighted in [we] would have given
her; but with the tears running down her cheeks
she said she durst not be seen to have any, for if
Powhatan should know it she were but dead; and
so she ran away by herself as she came. Within
less than an hour eight or ten stalwart Indians
appeared, bringing venison and other dainties, and
begged the English to put out the matches of their
matchlocks, for the smell of the smoke made them
sick. Our narrator tells us nothing of the sardonic
smile which we are sure that he and his comrades
can hardly have suppressed. The captain
sent the messengers back to Father Powhatan,
with a concise but significant message:
"If he is coming to visit me to-night let
him make haste, for I am ready to receive
him." One can imagine how such an announcement
would chill the zeal of the Indians.
A few of their scouts prowled about, but the English
kept vigilant guard till high tide and then
sailed away. A queer interview it had been.
With some of hell's fiercest passions smouldering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
beneath the surface, an explosion had been prevented
by watchful tact on the one side and vague
dread on the other. Peace had been preserved
between the strange white chieftain and his dusky
father, and two Englishmen were left at Werowocomoco,
with the four Germans, to go on with the
house-building. If our chronicle is to be trusted,
the Germans played a base part. Believing that
the English colony would surely perish of famine,
they sought their own profit in fraternizing with
the Indians. So, no sooner had Smith's vessels
departed from Werowocomoco on their way up to
Opekankano's village, than two of these "damned
Dutchmen," as the narrator calls them, went overland
to Jamestown and said that Captain Smith
had sent them for more weapons; in this way they
got a number of swords, pikes, muskets, and hatchets,
and traded them off to the redskins at Werowocomoco.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Opekankano was brought to terms.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Smith's party arrived at Opekankano's
village, near the place where the Pamunkey
and Mattapony rivers unite to form the York.
The chief of the Pamunkeys received them with
smiles and smooth words, but seems to have meditated
treachery. At all events the Englishmen so
interpreted it when they found themselves unexpectedly
surrounded by a great crowd of armed
warriors numbering several hundreds. It
was not prudent to fire on such a number
if it could be avoided; actual bloodshed
might do more harm than good; a peaceable
display of boldness was better. It might have been
and probably was remembered that the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
in the West Indies had often overawed all opposition
by seizing the person of the chief. After a
brief consultation Smith, accompanied by West
and Percy and Russell, rushed into Opekankano's
house, seized him by the long scalp-lock, dragged
him before the astonished multitude, and held a
pistol to his breast. Such prompt audacity was its
own safeguard. The corn was soon forthcoming,
and the little expedition made its way back to
Jamestown, loaded with some 300 bushels of it,
besides a couple of hundredweight of venison and
deer suet. In itself it was but a trifle of a pound
of meat and a bushel and a half of grain for each
person in the colony. But the chief result was
the profound impression made upon the Indians.
A few years later such a bold treatment of them
would have been attended with far more difficulty
and danger, would seldom indeed have been possible.
But in 1609 the red man had not yet learned
to gauge the killing capacity of the white man; he
was aware of terrible powers there which he could
not estimate, and was therefore inclined to err
on the side of prudence. This sudden irruption
of about forty white men into the principal Indian
villages and their masterful demeanour there
seemed to show that after all it would be wiser to
have them for friends than for enemies. A couple
of accidents confirmed this view of the case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Smith as a worker of miracles.</div>

<p>One day as three of the Chickahominy tribe
were loitering about Jamestown, admiring the
rude fortifications, one of them stole a pistol and
fled to the woods with it. His two comrades were
arrested and one was held in durance, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>other was sent out to recover the pistol. He was
made to understand that if he failed to bring it
back, the hostage would be put to death. As it
was intensely cold, some charcoal was charitably
furnished for the prisoner's hut. In the
evening his friend returned with the pistol,
and then the prisoner was found
apparently dead, suffocated with the fumes of the
charcoal, whereupon the friend broke forth into
loud lamentations. But the Englishmen soon perceived
that some life was still left in the unconscious
and prostrate form, and Smith told the
wailing Indian that he could restore his friend to
life, only there must be no more stealing. Then
with brandy and vinegar and friction the failing
heart and arteries were stimulated to their work,
the dead savage came to life, and the two comrades,
each with a small present of copper, went
on their way rejoicing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A pretty accident.</div>

<p>The other affair was more tragic. An Indian
at Werowocomoco had got possession of a bag of
gunpowder, and was playing with it while his comrades
were pressing closely about him, when all at
once it took fire and exploded, killing three or four
of the group and scorching the rest. Whereupon
our chronicler tells us, "These and other
such pretty accidents so amazed and affrighted
Powhatan and all his people, that from
all parts with presents they desired peace, returning
many stolen things which we never demanded
nor thought of; and after that ... all the country
became absolutely as free for us as for themselves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Communism.</div>

<p>The good effects of this were soon apparent.
With his mind relieved from anxiety about the
Indians, Smith had his hands free for work at
Jamestown. One of the most serious difficulties
under which the colony laboured was the communistic
plan upon which it had been started. The
settlers had come without wives and children, and
each man worked not to acquire property for himself
and his family but to further the general purposes
of the colony. In planting corn, in felling
trees, in repairing the fortifications, even in hunting
or fishing, he was working for the
community; whatsoever he could get by
his own toil or by trade with the natives went
straightway into the common stock, and the skilful
and industrious fared no better than the stupid
and lazy. The strongest kind of premium was
thus at once put upon idleness, which under circumstances
of extreme anxiety and depression is
apt enough to flourish without any premium.
Things had arrived at such a pass that some thirty
or forty men were supporting the whole company
of two hundred, when President Smith applied the
strong hand. He gathered them all together one
day and plainly told them that he was their lawfully
chosen ruler and should promptly punish all
infractions of discipline, and they must all understand
that hereafter he that will not work shall
not eat. His authority had come to be great, and
the rule was enforced. By the end of April some
twenty houses had been built, a well of pure sweet
water had been dug in the fort, thirty acres or
more of ground had been broken up and planted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and nets and weirs arranged for fishing. A few
hogs and fowl had been left by Newport, and now
could be heard the squeals of sixty pigs and the
peeping of five hundred spring chickens. The
manufacture of tar and soap-ashes went on, and a
new fortress was begun in an easily defensible
position upon a commanding hill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unbidden messmates.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of Argall.</div>

<p>This useful work was suddenly interrupted by
an unforeseen calamity. Rats brought from time
to time by the ships had quickly multiplied, and in
April these unbidden guests were found
to have made such havoc in the granaries
that but little corn was left. Harvest time
was a long way off, and it was necessary to pause
for a while and collect provisions. Several Indian
villages were again visited and trading went on
amicably, but there was a limit to the aid the barbarians
had it in their power to give, and in the
quest of sustenance the settlers were scattered.
By midsummer a few were picking berries in the
woods, others were quartered among the Indians,
some were living on oysters and caviar, some were
down at Point Comfort catching fish, and it was
these that were the first to hail the bark of young
Samuel Argall, who was coming for sturgeon and
whatever else he could find, and had steered a
straighter course from London than any
mariner before him. Argall brought letters
from members of the Company complaining
that the goods sent home in the ships were not of
greater value in the market, and saying that Smith
had been accused of dealing harshly with the Indians.
This must have referred to some skir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>mishes
he had had with the Rappahannocks and
other tribes in the course of his exploration of the
Chesapeake waters during the previous summer.
Another piece of news was brought by Argall.
The London Company had obtained a new charter,
and a great expedition, commanded by Lord
Delaware, was about to sail for Virginia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second Charter of the London Company, 1609.</div>

<p>This was true. The experience of two years
had convinced the Company that its methods
needed mending. In the first place more money
was needed and the list of shareholders
was greatly enlarged. By the second
charter, dated May 23, 1609, the Company
was made a corporation and all its
members were mentioned by name. The list was
headed by Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, and
contained among other interesting names those of
the philosopher Bacon and of Sir Oliver Cromwell,
from whose nephew, then a lad at Huntingdon
School, the world was by and by to hear. On
the list we find the names of 659 persons, of whom
21 were peers, 96 were knights, 11 were clergymen
and physicians, 53 are described as captains,
28 as engineers, 58 as gentlemen, 110 as merchants,
while the remaining 282 are variously designated
or only the name is given. "Of these
about 230 paid £37 10s., or more, about 229 paid
less than £37 10s., and about 200 failed to pay
anything."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> It should be borne in mind that £37
10s. at that time was equivalent to at least $750
of to-day. Besides these individuals, the list contains
the companies of mercers, grocers, drapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
fishmongers, vintners, brewers, masons, lawyers,
fletchers, armourers, and others,&mdash;in all fifty-six
companies of the city of London. Such a list,
as well as the profusion of sermons and tracts
on Virginia that were poured forth at the time,
bespeaks a general interest in the enterprise.
The Company was incorporated under the name
of "The Treasurer and Company of Adventurers
and Planters of the City of London for the First
Colony in Virginia." Nothing was said about the
Second Colony, so that by this charter the London
Company was unyoked from the Plymouth Company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The council in London.</div>

<p>The jurisdiction of the reorganized London
Company was to extend 200 miles south and 200
miles north of Old Point Comfort, which would
not quite contain all of North Carolina but would
easily include Maryland and Delaware. The government
of this region was vested in a
supreme council sitting in London, the
constitution of which was remarkable. Its members
were at the outset appointed by the king, but
all vacancies were thereafter to be filled by the
vote of the whole body of 659 persons and 56 trade-guilds
constituting the Company. The sole power
of legislation for Virginia, with the right to appoint
all colonial officers, was vested in the council.
Besides thus exercising entire sovereignty over Virginia,
the Company was authorized to levy and collect
custom-house duties and even to wage war for
purely defensive purposes. Thus this great corporation
was made virtually independent of Parliament,
with a representative government of its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The local government.</div>

<p>As for the local government in Virginia, it was
entirely changed. The working of the local council
with its elected president had been
simply ludicrous. Two presidents had
been deposed and sent home, while the councillors
had done nothing but quarrel and threaten each
other's lives, and one had been shot for mutiny.
Order and quiet had not been attained until President
Smith became autocratic, after the other
members of the council had departed or died.
Now the new charter abolished the local council,
and the direct rule was to be exercised by a governor
with autocratic power over the settlers, but
responsible to the supreme council in London, by
which he was appointed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas, Lord Delaware.</div>

<p>For the Company as thus reorganized the two
most important executive offices were filled by
admirable appointments. The treasurer was the
eminent merchant Sir Thomas Smith, of whom
some account has already been given. For governor
of Virginia the council appointed
Thomas West, third Baron Delaware,
whose younger brother, Francis West,
we have seen helping John Smith to browbeat the
Indians at Werowocomoco and Pamunkey. This
Lord Delaware belonged to a family distinguished
for public service. On the mother's side he was
nearly related to Queen Elizabeth. In America he
is forever identified with the history of Virginia,
and he has left a name to one of our great rivers,
to a very interesting group of Indians, and to one
of the smallest states in our Union. With New
England, too, he has one link of association; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
his sister, Penelope West, married Herbert Pelham,
and their son was the first treasurer of Harvard
College. Thomas West, born in 1577, was
educated at Oxford, served with distinction in the
Netherlands, and was knighted for bravery in
1599. He succeeded to the barony of Delaware
in 1602, and was a member of the Privy Council
of Elizabeth and James I. No one was more
warmly enlisted than he in the project of founding
Protestant English colonies in the New World.
To this cause he devoted himself with ever growing
enthusiasm, and when the London Company
was remodelled he was appointed governor of Virginia
for life. With him were associated the
sturdy soldier, Sir Thomas Gates, as lieutenant-governor,
and the old sea rover, Sir George
Somers, as admiral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A communistic programme.</div>

<p>The spring of 1609 was spent in organizing a
new expedition, while Smith and his weary followers
were struggling with the damage wrought by
rats. People out of work were attracted by the
communistic programme laid down by the Company.
The shares were rated at about $300 each,
to use our modern figures, and emigration to
Virginia entitled the emigrant to one share. So
far as needful the proceeds of the enterprise
"were to be spent upon the settlement,
and the surplus was either to be
divided or funded for seven years. During that
period the settlers were to be maintained at the
expense of the Company, while all the product
of their labours was to be cast into the common
stock. At the end of that time every shareholder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
was to receive a grant of land in proportion to
his stock held."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Doubtless the prospects of becoming
a shareholder in a great speculative enterprise,
and of being supported by the Company,
must have seemed alluring to many people in
difficult circumstances. At all events, some 500
people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;were got
together. A fleet of nine ships, with ample supplies,
was entrusted to Newport, and in his ship,
the Sea Venture, were Gates and Somers, who
were to take the colony under their personal supervision.
Lord Delaware remained in London,
planning further developments of the enterprise.
Three more trusty men he could hardly have sent
out. But a strange fate was knocking at the
door.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wreck of the Sea Venture.</div>

<p>On the first of June, 1609, the fleet set sail and
took the route by the Azores. Toward the end of
July, as they were getting within a week's sail of
the American coast, the ships were "caught in the
tail of a hurricane," one of them was sunk, and
the Sea Venture was separated from all
the rest. That gallant ship was sorely
shaken and torn, so that for five days the crew
toiled steadily in relays, pumping and baling,
while the water seemed to be gaining upon them.
Many of the passengers abandoned themselves to
despair and to rum, or, as an eye-witness tells us,
"some of them, having good and comfortable
waters in the ship, fetched them and drank one to
the other, taking their last leave one of the other
until their more joyful and happy meeting in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
more blessed world."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The company were saved
by the skill and energy of the veteran Somers, who
for three days and nights never once left the quarter-deck.
At length land was sighted, and presently
the Sea Venture was driven violently aground
and wedged immovable between two rocks, a shattered
wreck. But all her people, a hundred and
fifty or so, were saved, and most of their gear was
brought away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bermudas.</div>

<p>The island on which they were wrecked was one
of a group the early history of which is shrouded
in strange mystery. If my own solution of an
obscure problem is to be trusted, these islands had
once a fierce cannibal population, whose first white
visitors, Vincent Pinzon and Americus Vespucius,
landed among them on St. Bernard's day in
August, 1498, and carried off more than 200
slaves.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Hence the place was called St. Bernard's
archipelago, but on crudely glimmering maps went
wide astray and soon lost its identity.
In 1522 a Spanish captain, Juan Bermudez,
happened to land there and his name has
remained. But in the intervening years Spanish
slave-hunters from San Domingo had infested
those islands and reaped and gleaned the harvest
of heathen flesh till no more was to be had. The
ruthless cannibals were extirpated by the more
ruthless seekers for gold, and when Bermudez
stopped there he found no human inhabitants, but
only swine running wild, a sure witness to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
recent presence of Europeans. Then for nearly a
century the unvisited spot was haunted by the
echoes of a frightful past, wild traditions of ghoulish
orgies and infernal strife. But the kidnapper's
work in which these vague notions originated was
so soon forgotten that when the Sea Venture was
wrecked those islands were believed to have
been from time immemorial uninhabited. Sailors
shunned them as a scene of abominable sorceries,
and called them the Isles of Demons. Otherwise
they were known simply by the Spanish skipper's
name as the Bermoothes, afterward more completely
anglicized into Bermudas. From the soil
of those foul goblin legends, that shuddering reminiscence
of inexpiable crime, the potent sorcery
of genius has reared one of the most exquisitely
beautiful, ethereally delicate works of human
fancy that the world has ever seen. The wreck of
the Sea Venture suggested to Shakespeare many
hints for the Tempest, which was written within
the next two years and performed before the king
in 1611. It is not that these islands were conceived
as the scene of the comedy; the command
to Ariel to go and "fetch dew from the still-vexed
Bermoothes" seems enough to show that Prospero's
enchanted isle was elsewhere, doubtless in
some fairy universe hard by the Mediterranean.
But from the general conception of monsters of the
isle down to such incidents as the flashing light on
the shrouds of the ship, it is clear that Shakespeare
made use of Strachey's narrative of the wreck of
the Sea Venture, published in 1610.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of
the pinnaces
at Jamestown,

<p>Gates and Somers found the Isles of Demons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>far pleasanter than their reputation, and it was
well for them that it was so, for they were obliged
to stay there nearly ten months, while
with timber freshly cut and with bolts
and beams from the wreck the party
built two pinnaces which they named
Patience and Deliverance. They laid in ample
stores of salted pork and fish, traversed the 700
miles of ocean in a fortnight, and arrived at
Jamestown on the 10th of May, 1610. The spectacle
that greeted them was enough to have appalled
the stoutest heart. To explain it in a few
words, we must go back to August, 1609, when
the seven ships that had weathered the storm
arrived in Virginia and landed their 300 or more
passengers, known in history as the Third Supply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of
the Third
Supply,

<div class="sidenote">Smith returns
to
England,
October,
1609.</div>

<p>Since the new dignitaries and all their official
documents were in the Bermuda wreck, there was
no one among the new-comers in Virginia
competent to succeed Smith in the government,
but the mischief-makers, Ratcliffe
and Archer, were unfortunately
among them, and the former instantly called upon
Smith to abdicate in his favour. He had persuaded
many of the new-comers to support him,
but the old settlers were loyal to Smith, and there
was much confusion until the latter arrested Ratcliffe
as a disturber of the peace. The quality of
the new emigration was far inferior to the older.
The older settlers were mostly gentlemen of character;
of the new ones far too many were shiftless
vagabonds, or, as Smith says, "unruly gallants,
packed thither by their friends to escape ill desti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>nies."
They were sure to make trouble, but for
a while Smith held them in check. The end of his
stay in Virginia was, however, approaching.
He was determined to find some
better site for a colony than the low
marshy Jamestown; so in September he
sailed up to the Indian village called Powhatan and
bought of the natives a tract of land in that neighbourhood
near to where Richmond now stands,&mdash;a
range of hills, salubrious and defensible, with
so fair a landscape that Smith called the place
Nonesuch. On the way back to Jamestown a bag
of gunpowder in his boat exploded and wounded
him so badly that he was completely disabled.
The case demanded such surgery as Virginia could
not furnish, and as the ships were sailing for England
early in October he went in one of them. He
seems also to have welcomed this opportunity of
answering sundry charges brought against him by
the Ratcliffe faction. Some flying squirrels were
sent home to amuse King James.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Delaware
sails
for Virginia,
April, 1610.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Horrible sufferings.</div>

<p>The arrival of the ships in England, with news
of the disappearance of the Sea Venture and the
danger of anarchy in Virginia, alarmed
Lord Delaware, and he resolved to go
as soon as possible and take command of
his colony. About the first of April he set sail
with about 150 persons, mostly mechanics. He
had need to make all haste. Jamestown had become
a pandemonium. Smith left George Percy
in command, but that excellent gentleman was in
poor health and unable to exert much authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
There were now 500 mouths to be filled, and the
stores of food diminished with portentous rapidity.
The "unruly gallants" got into trouble with
the Indians, who soon responded after their manner.
They slaughtered the settlers' hogs for their
own benefit, and they murdered the settlers themselves
when opportunity was offered. The worthless
Ratcliffe and thirty of his men were slain at
one fell swoop while they were at the Pamunkey
village, trading with The Powhatan.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> As the
frosts and snows came more shelter was needed
than the cabins already built could furnish. Many
died of the cold. The approach of spring saw the
last supplies of food consumed, and famine began
to claim its victims. Soon there came to be more
houses than occupants, and as fast as one was
emptied by death it was torn down for firewood.
Even palisades were stripped from their framework
and thrown into the blaze, for cold was a
nearer foe than the red men. The latter
watched the course of events with savage
glee, and now and then, lurking in the neighbourhood,
shot flights of arrows tipped with death.
A gang of men stole one of the pinnaces, armed
her heavily, and ran out to sea, to help themselves
by piracy. After the last basket of corn had been
devoured, people lived for a while on roots and
herbs, after which they had recourse to cannibalism.
The corpse of a slain Indian was boiled and
eaten. Then the starving company began cooking
their own dead. One man killed his wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
salted her, and had eaten a considerable part of
her body before he was found out. This was too
much for people to endure; the man was tied to a
stake and burned alive. Such were the goings on
in that awful time, to which men long afterward
alluded as the Starving Time. No wonder that
one poor wretch, crazed with agony, cast his Bible
into the fire, crying "Alas! there is no God."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virginia abandoned.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of Lord Delaware, June 8, 1610.</div>

<p>When Smith left the colony in October, it numbered
about 500 souls. When Gates and Somers
and Newport arrived from the Bermudas in May,
they found a haggard remnant of 60 all told, men,
women, and children scarcely able to totter about
the ruined village, and with the gleam of madness
in their eyes. The pinnaces brought food for
their relief, but with things in such a state there
was no use in trying to get through the summer.
The provisions in store would not last a month.
The three brave captains consulted together and
decided, with tears in their eyes, that Virginia
must be abandoned. Since Raleigh first began,
every attempt had ended in miserable
failure and this last calamity was the
most crushing of all. What hope could there be
that North America would ever be colonized?
What men could endure more than had been endured
already? It was decided to go up to the
Newfoundland fishing stations and get fish there,
and then cross to England. On Thursday the
7th of June, 1610, to the funereal roll of drums,
the cabins were stripped of such things as could
be carried away, and the doleful company went
aboard the pinnaces, weighed anchor, and started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>down the river. As the arching trees at Jamestown
receded from the view and the sombre silence
of the forest settled over the deserted spot,
it seemed indeed that "earth's paradise," Virginia,
the object of so much longing, the scene of so
much fruitless striving, was at last abandoned to
its native Indians. But it had been otherwise decreed.
That night a halt was made at Mulberry
Island, and next morning the voyage was resumed.
Toward noonday, as the little ships were
speeding their way down the ever widening river,
a black speck was seen far below on the
broad waters of Hampton Roads, and
every eye was strained. It was no red
man's canoe. It was a longboat. Yes, Heaven be
praised! the governor's own longboat with a message.
His three well-stocked ships had passed
Point Comfort, and he himself was with them!</p>

<p>Despair gave place to exultant hope, words of
gratitude and congratulation were exchanged, and
the prows were turned up-stream. On Sunday
the three staunch captains stood with their followers
drawn up in military array before the dismantled
ruins of Jamestown, while Lord Delaware
stepped from his boat, and, falling upon his knees
on the shore, lifted his hands in prayer, thanking
God that he had come in time to save Virginia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="c">BEGINNINGS OF A COMMONWEALTH.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Indian corn.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of Smith's work.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> late years there has been some discussion as
to which of the flowers or plants indigenous to the
New World might most properly be selected as a
national emblem for the United States of America,
and many persons have expressed a preference
for that most beautiful of cereals, Indian
corn. Certainly it would be difficult to
overrate the historic importance of this plant. Of
the part which it played in aboriginal America I
have elsewhere treated.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> To the first English settlers
it was of vital consequence. But for Indian
corn the company of Pilgrims at Plymouth would
have succumbed to famine, like so many other such
little colonies. The settlers at Jamestown depended
upon corn from the outset, and when the supply
stopped the Starving Time came quickly. We can
thus appreciate the value to the Pilgrims of the alliance
with Massasoit, and to the Virginians of the
amicable relations for some time maintained with
The Powhatan. We are also furnished with the
means of estimating the true importance of John
Smith and his work in the first struggle of English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>civilization with the wilderness. Whether we suppose
that Smith in his writings unduly
exalts his own work or not, one thing is
clear. It is impossible to read his narrative
without recognizing the hand of a man supremely
competent to deal with barbarians. No
such character as that which shines out through
his pages could ever have been invented. To
create such a man by an effort of imagination
would have been far more difficult than to be such
a man. One of the first of Englishmen to deal
with Indians, he had no previous experience to aid
him; yet nowhere have the red men been more
faithfully portrayed than in his pages, and one
cannot fail to note this unrivalled keenness of observation,
which combined with rare sagacity and
coolness to make him always say and do the right
things at the right times. These qualities kept the
Indians from hostility and made them purveyors
to the needs of the little struggling colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nobility of his nature.</div>

<p>Besides these qualities Smith had others which
marked him out as a natural leader of men. His
impulsiveness and plain speaking, as well as his
rigid enforcement of discipline, made him some
bitter enemies, but his comrades in general spoke
of him in terms of strong admiration and devotion.
His nature was essentially noble, and his
own words bear witness to it, as in the
following exhortation: "Seeing we are
not born for ourselves, but each to help other, and
our abilities are much alike at the hour of our birth
and the minute of our death; seeing our good
deeds and our bad, by faith in Christ's merits, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
all we have to carry our souls to heaven or to hell;
seeing honour is our lives' ambition, and our ambition
after death to have an honourable memory
of our life; and seeing by no means we would be
abated of the dignities and glories of our predecessors,
let us imitate their virtues to be worthily
their successors." So wrote the man of whom
Thomas Fuller quaintly said that he had "a
prince's heart in a beggar's purse," and to whom
one of his comrades, a survivor of the Starving
Time, afterward paid this touching tribute:
"Thus we lost him that in all our proceedings
made justice his first guide, ... ever hating baseness,
sloth, pride, and indignity more than any
dangers; that never allowed more for himself than
his soldiers with him; that upon no danger would
send them where he would not lead them himself;
that would never see us want what he either had
or could by any means get us; that would rather
want than borrow, or starve than not pay; that
loved action more than words, and hated falsehood
and covetousness worse than death; whose adventures
were our lives and whose loss our deaths."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">But for Smith the colony would probably have perished.</div>

<p>It is, indeed, in all probability true that losing
Smith was the chief cause of the horrors of the
Starving Time. The colony was not ill supplied
when he left it, in October, 1609, for the stock of
hogs had increased to about 600, and the Third
Supply had brought sheep and goats as well as
horses. All this advantage had been destroyed by
the active hostility of the Indians, which was due
to the outrageous conduct of white ruffians whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Smith would have restrained or punished. But
for this man's superb courage and resourcefulness,
one can hardly believe that
the colony would have lasted until 1609.
More likely it would have perished in
one of the earlier seasons of sore trial. It would
have succumbed like Lane's colony, and White's,
and Popham's; one more would have been added
to the sickening list of failures, and the hopes
built upon Virginia in England would have been
sadly dashed. The utmost ingenuity on the part
of Smith's detractors can never do away with the
fact that his personal qualities did more than anything
else to prevent such a direful calamity; and
for this reason he will always remain a great and
commanding figure in American history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three sources of weakness.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Delaware's administration.</div>

<p>The arrival of Lord Delaware in June, 1610,
was the prelude to a new state of things. The
pathetic scene in which that high-minded nobleman
knelt in prayer upon the shore at Jamestown
heralded the end of the chaos through which Smith
had steered the colony. But the change was not
effected all in a moment. The evils were too deep-seated
for that. There had been three principal
sources of weakness: first, the lack of
a strong government with unquestioned
authority; secondly, the system of communism
in labour and property; thirdly, the low
character of the emigrants. This last statement
does not apply to the earlier settlers so much as
to those who began to come in 1609. The earliest
companies were mainly composed of respectable
persons, but as the need for greater numbers grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>imperative, inducements were held out which attracted
a much lower grade of people. Neither
this evil nor the evils flowing from communism
were remedied during Lord Delaware's brief rule,
but the first evil was entirely removed. In such
a rude settlement a system by which a council
elected its president annually, and could depose
him at any time, was sure to breed faction and
strife; strong government had been attained only
when the strong man Smith was left virtually
alone by the death or departure of the other councillors.
Now there was no council, but instead of
it a governor appointed in London and clothed
with despotic power. Lord Delaware was a man
of strict integrity, kind and humane, with a talent
for command, and he was obeyed. His first act on
that memorable June Sunday, after a sermon had
been preached and his commission read, was to
make a speech to the settlers, in which, to cite his
own words, "I did lay some blames on them for
many vanities and their idleness, earnestly wishing
that I might no more find it so, lest I should be
compelled to draw the sword of justice
to cut off such delinquents, which I had
much rather draw in their defence to
protect from enemies."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Happily he was not
called upon to draw it except against the Indians,
to whom he administered some wholesome doses of
chastisement. The colonists were kept at work,
new fortifications were erected and dismantled
houses put in repair. The little church assumed
a comfortable and dignified appearance, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
cedar pews and walnut altar, its tall pulpit and
baptismal font. The governor was extremely
fond of flowers and at all services would have
the church decorated with the bright and fragrant
wild growth of the neighbourhood. At such times
he always appeared in the full dignity of velvet
and lace, attended by a body-guard of spearmen
in scarlet cloaks. A full-toned bell was hung in
its place, and daily it notified the little industrial
army when to begin and when to leave off the
work of the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Somers, and cruise of Argall, 1610.</div>

<p>Discipline was rigidly maintained, but the old
danger of famine was not yet fully overcome.
The difficulty was foreseen immediately after Delaware's
arrival, and the veteran Somers at once
sailed with the two pinnaces for the Bermudas,
intending to bring back a cargo of salted pork
and live hogs for breeding. His consort was commanded
by Samuel Argall, a young kinsman of
Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer of the London
Company. The two ships were parted by bad
weather, and Somers, soon after landing at Bermuda,
fell sick and died, with his last
breath commanding his men to fulfil
their errand and go back to Virginia.
But they, disgusted with the wilderness and thinking
only of themselves, went straight to England,
taking with them the old knight's body embalmed.
As for young Argall, the stress of weather drove
him to Cape Cod, where he caught many fish;
then cruising along the coast he reached Chesapeake
Bay and went up the Potomac River, where
he found a friend in the head sachem of the Poto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>mac
tribe and bought as much corn as his ship
could carry. With these welcome supplies Argall
reached Jamestown in September, and then Newport
took the ships back to England, carrying with
him Sir Thomas Gates to make a report of all that
had happened and to urge the Company to fresh
exertions. The winter of 1610-11 was a hard
one, though not to be compared with the Starving
Time of the year before. There were about 150
deaths, and Lord Delaware, becoming too ill to
discharge his duties, sailed for England in March,
1611, intending to send Gates immediately back
to Virginia. George Percy, who had commanded
the colony through the Starving Time, was again
left in charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Thomas Dale.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Company had been bestirring
itself. A survey of the subscription list for that
winter shows that English pluck was getting
aroused; the colony must be set upon its feet.
The list of craftsmen desired for Virginia is curious
and interesting: millwrights, iron founders,
makers of edge tools, colliers, woodcutters, ship-wrights,
fishermen, husbandmen, gardeners, bricklayers,
lime-burners, blacksmiths, shoemakers,
coopers, turners, gunmakers, wheelwrights, masons,
millers, bakers, and brewers figure on the
list with many others. But there must have been
difficulty in getting enough of such respectable
workmen together in due season for Newport's
return trip; for when that mariner started in
March, 1611, with three ships and 300 passengers,
it was a more shiftless and graceless set of
ne'er-do-weels than had ever been sent out before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>One lesson, however, had been learned; and victuals
enough were taken to last the whole colony
for a year. Gates, the deputy-governor, was
not ready to go, and his place was supplied by
Sir Thomas Dale, who for the purpose
was appointed High Marshal of Virginia.
Under that designation this remarkable
man ruled the colony for the next five years,
though his superior, Gates, was there with him for
a small part of the time. Lord Delaware, whose
tenure of office as governor was for life, remained
during those five years in England. If the Company
erred in sending out scapegraces for settlers,
it did its best to repair the error in sending such
a man as Dale to govern them. Hard-headed,
indomitable, bristling with energy, full of shrewd
common-sense, Sir Thomas Dale was always equal
to the occasion, and under his masterful guidance
Virginia came out from the valley of the shadow
of death. He was a soldier who had seen some of
the hardest fighting in the Netherlands, and had
afterward been attached to the suite of Henry,
Prince of Wales. He was connected by marriage
with Sir Walter Raleigh and with the Berkeleys.</p>

<p>Dale was a true English mastiff, faithful and
kind but formidable when aroused, and capable of
showing at times some traits of the old wolf. The
modern excess of pity misdirected, which tries to
save the vilest murderers from the gallows, would
have been to him incomprehensible. To the upright
he was a friend and helper; toward depraved
offenders he was merciless, and among those over
whom he was called to rule there were many such.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
John Smith judiciously criticised the policy of the
Company in sending out such people; for, he says,
"when neither the fear of God, nor shame, nor
displeasure of their friends could rule them [in
England], there is small hope ever to bring one
in twenty of them ever to be good [in Virginia],
Notwithstanding I confess divers amongst them
had better minds and grew much more industrious
than was expected; yet ten good workmen would
have done more substantial work in a day than
ten of them in a week."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It was not against those
who had better minds that Dale's heavy hand was
directed; it was reserved for the incorrigible and
crushed them. When he reached Jamestown, in
May, 1611, he found that the two brief months of
Percy's mild rule had already begun to bear ill
fruit; men were playing at bowls in working
hours, quite oblivious of planting and hoeing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Draconian code.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cruel punishments.</div>

<p>To meet the occasion, a searching code of laws
had already been sanctioned by the Company. In
this code several capital crimes were
specified. Among them were failure to
attend the church services, or blaspheming God's
name, or speaking "against the known articles of
the Christian faith." Any man who should "unworthily
demean himself "toward a clergyman, or
fail to "hold him in all reverent regard," was to
be thrice publicly whipped, and after each whipping
was to make public acknowledgment of the
heinousness of his crime and the justice of the
punishment. Not only to speak evil of the king,
but even to vilify the London Company, was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>treasonable offence, to be punished with death.
Other capital offences were unlicensed trading
with the Indians, the malicious uprooting of a
crop, or the slaughter of cattle or poultry without
the High Marshal's permission. For remissness
in the daily work various penalties were assigned,
and could be inflicted at the discretion of a court-martial.
One of the first results of this strict
discipline was a conspiracy to overthrow and perhaps
murder Dale. The principal leader was that
Jeffrey Abbot whom we have seen accompanying
Smith on his last journey to Werowocomoco. The
plot was detected, and Abbot and five
other ringleaders were put to death in
what the narrator calls a "cruel and unusual"
manner, using the same adjectives which happen
to occur in our Federal Constitution in its prohibition
of barbarous punishments. It seems clear
that at least one of the offenders was broken on
the wheel, after the French fashion; and on some
other occasion a lawbreaker "had a bodkin thrust
through his tongue and was chained to a tree till
he perished." But these were rare and extreme
cases; the ordinary capital punishments were
simply hanging and shooting, and they were summarily
employed. Ralph Hamor, however, one of
the most intelligent and fair-minded of contemporary
chroniclers, declares that Dale's severity was
less than the occasion demanded, and that he could
not have been more lenient without imperilling
the existence of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> So the "Apostle of
Virginia," the noble Alexander Whitaker, seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to have thought, for he held the High Marshal in
great esteem. "Sir Thomas Dale," said he, "is a
man of great knowledge in divinity, and of a good
conscience in all things, both which be rare in a
martial man." In his leisure moments the stern
soldier liked nothing so well as to sit and discuss
abstruse points of theology with this excellent clergyman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Communism in practice.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of abolishing communism.</div>

<p>But Dale was something more than a strong
ruler and merciless judge. With statesmanlike
insight he struck at one of the deepest roots of the
evils which had afflicted the colony. Nothing had
done so much to discourage steady labour and to
foster idleness and mischief as the communism
which had prevailed from the
beginning. This compulsory system of throwing
all the earnings into a common stock had just
suited the lazy ones. Your true communist is the
man who likes to live on the fruits of other people's
labour. If you look for him in these days
you are pretty sure to find him in a lager beer
saloon, talking over schemes for rebuilding the
universe. In the early days of Virginia the creature's
nature was the same, and about one fifth of
the population was thus called upon to support the
whole. Under such circumstances it is wonderful
that the colony survived until Dale could come
and put an end to the system. It would not have
done so, had not Smith and Delaware been able
more or less to compel the laggards to work under
penalties. Dale's strong common-sense taught
him that to put men under the influence of the
natural incentives to labour was better than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>drive them to it by whipping them and slitting
their ears. Only thus could the character of the
colonists be permanently improved and
the need for harsh punishments relaxed.
So the worthy Dale took it upon himself
to reform the whole system. The colonist, from
being a member of an industrial army, was at
once transformed into a small landed proprietor,
with three acres to cultivate for his own use and
behoof, on condition of paying a tax of six bushels
of corn into the public treasury, which in that
primitive time was the public granary. Though
the change was but partially accomplished in
Dale's time, the effect was magical. Industry and
thrift soon began to prevail, crimes and disorders
diminished, gallows and whipping-post found less
to do, and the gaunt wolf of famine never again
thrust his head within the door.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "City of Henricus."</div>

<p>Six months after Dale's administration had begun,
a fresh supply of settlers raised the whole
number to nearly 800, and a good stock of cows,
oxen, and goats was added to their resources. The
colony now began to expand itself beyond the
immediate neighbourhood of Jamestown. Already
there was a small settlement at the river's mouth,
near the site of Hampton. The want of
a better site than Jamestown was freely
admitted, and Dale selected the Dutch
Gap peninsula. He built a palisade across the
neck and blockhouses in suitable positions. The
population of about 300 souls were accommodated
with houses arranged in three streets, and there
was a church and a storehouse. This new creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Dale called the City of Henricus, after his patron
Prince Henry. A city, in any admissible sense of
the word, it never became, but it left its name
upon Henrico County. Afterward Dale founded
other communities at Bermuda and Shirley Hundreds,
and left his name upon the settlement
known as Dale's Gift on the eastern peninsula
near Cape Charles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pocahontas seized by Argall, 1612.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Marriage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe, April, 1614.</div>

<p>This expansion of the colony made it more than
ever desirable to pacify the Indians, whose attitude
had been hostile ever since Smith's departure.
During all this time nothing had been seen of
Pocahontas, whose visits to Jamestown had been
so frequent, but that can hardly be called strange,
since her tribe was on the war-path against the
English. The chronicler Strachey says
that in 1610, being about fifteen years
old, she was married to a chieftain named
Kocoum. Be that as it may, it is certain that in
1612 young Captain Argall found her staying
with the Potomac tribe, whose chief he bribed
with a copper kettle to connive at her abduction.
She was inveigled on board Argall's ship and
taken to Jamestown, to be held as a hostage for
her father's good behaviour.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> It is not clear what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>might have come of this, for The Powhatan's conduct
was so unsatisfactory that Dale had about
made up his mind to use fire and sword against
him, when all at once the affair took an unexpected
turn. Among the passengers on the ill-fated
Sea Venture were John Rolfe and his wife,
of Heacham, in Norfolk. During their stay on
the Bermuda Islands, a daughter was born to them
and christened Bermuda. Shortly after their
arrival in Virginia, Mrs. Rolfe died, and now an
affection sprang up between the widower and the
captive Pocahontas. Whether the Indian husband
of the latter (if Strachey is to be believed)
was living or dead, would make little difference
according to Indian notions; for among all the
Indian tribes, when first studied by white men,
marriage was a contract terminable at pleasure by
either party. Scruples of a different sort troubled
Rolfe, who hesitated about marrying a heathen
unless he could make it the occasion of saving her
soul from the Devil. This was easily achieved by
converting her to Christianity and baptizing
her with the Bible name Rebekah.
Sir Thomas Dale improved the occasion
to renew the old alliance with The Powhatan,
who may have welcomed such an escape
from a doubtful trial of arms; and the marriage
was solemnized in April, 1614, in the church at
Jamestown, in the presence of an amicable company
of Indians and Englishmen. One could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>wish that more of the details connected with this
affair had been observed and recorded for us, so
that modern studies of Indian law and custom
might be brought to bear upon them. How much
weight this alliance may have had with the Indians,
one can hardly say; but at all events they
made little or no trouble for the next eight years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Argall attacks the French</div>

<div class="sidenote">and warns the Dutch.</div>

<p>Other foes than red men called for Dale's attention.
In the neighbourhood of the Gulf of St.
Lawrence the French were as busily at work as
the English in Virginia. The 45th parallel, the
northern limit of oldest Virginia, runs through
the country now called Nova Scotia. At Port
Royal, on the Bay of Fundy, a small French colony
had been struggling against dire adversity
ever since 1604, and more lately a party of French
Jesuits had begun to make a settlement on Mount
Desert Island, off the coast of Maine. In one of
his fishing excursions Captain Argall
discovered this Jesuit settlement and
promptly extinguished it, carrying his
prisoners to Jamestown. Then Dale sent him
back to patrol that northern coast, and presently
Argall swooped upon Port Royal and burned it to
the ground, carrying off the live-stock as booty
and the inhabitants as prisoners. The French
ambassador in London protested and received
evasive answers until the affair was allowed to
drop and Port Royal was rebuilt without further
molestation by the English. These events were
the first premonition of a mighty conflict, not to
be fully entered upon till the days of Argall's
grandchildren, and not to be finally decided until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>the days of their grandchildren, when Wolfe
climbed the Heights of Abraham. We are told
that on his way back to Jamestown the unceremonious
Argall looked in at the Hudson
River, and finding Hendrick Christiansen
there with his colony of Dutch traders, ordered
him under penalty of a broadside to haul down
the flag of the Netherlands and run up the English
ensign. The philosophic Dutchman quietly
obeyed, but as soon as the ship was out of sight
he replaced his own flag, consigning Captain
Argall <i>sotto voce</i> to a much warmer place than
the Hudson River.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit of Pocahontas to London, 1616.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Her interview with Smith.</div>

<p>In 1616 George Yeardley, who was already in
Virginia, succeeded Sir Thomas Gates as deputy-governor,
and Dale, who had affairs in Europe
that needed attention, sailed for England. He
had much reason to feel proud of what had been
accomplished during his five years' rule. Strict
order had been maintained and the Indians had
been pacified, while the colony had trebled in
numbers, and symptoms of prosperity were everywhere
visible. In the ship which carried Dale to
England went John Rolfe and his wife
Pocahontas. Much ado was made over
the Indian woman, who was presented at
court by Lady Delaware and everywhere treated
as a princess. There is a trustworthy tradition
that King James was inclined to censure Rolfe for
marrying into a royal family without consulting
his own sovereign. In the English imagination
The Powhatan figured as a sovereign; and when
European feudal ideas were applied to the case it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>seemed as if in certain contingencies the infant
son of Rolfe and Pocahontas might become "King
of Virginia." The dusky princess was entertained
with banquets and receptions, she was often seen
at the theatre, and was watched with great curiosity
by the people. It was then that "La Belle
Sauvage" became a favourite name for London
taverns. Her portrait, engraved by the celebrated
artist, Simon Van Pass,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> shows us a rather handsome
and dignified young woman, with her neck
encircled by the broad serrated collar or ruff characteristic
of that period, an embroidered and jewelled
cap on her head, and a fan in her hand. The
inscription on the portrait gives her age as one-and-twenty,
which would make her thirteen at the
time when she rescued Captain Smith. While she
was in England, she had an interview with Smith.
He had made his exploring voyage on the New
England coast two years before, when he changed
the name of the country from North Virginia to
New England. In 1615 he had started in the service
of the Plymouth Company with an expedition
for colonizing New England, but had been captured
by French cruisers and carried to Rochelle.
After his return from France he was making preparations
for another voyage to New England,
when he heard of Pocahontas and
called on her. When he addressed her,
as all did in England, as Lady Rebekah, she
seemed hurt and turned away, covering her face
with her hands. She insisted upon calling him
Father and having him call her his child, as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>merly
in the wilderness. Then she added, "They
did always tell us you were dead, and I knew not
otherwise till I came to Plymouth."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Pocahontas, 1617.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A baffled census-taker.</div>

<p>Early in 1617 Argall was appointed deputy-governor
of Virginia and sailed in March to supersede
Yeardley. Rolfe was made secretary of the colony
and went in the same ship; but Pocahontas
fell suddenly ill, and died before leaving
Gravesend. She was buried in the
parish church there. Her son, Thomas
Rolfe, was left with an uncle in England, where
he grew to manhood. Then he went to Virginia,
to become the ancestor, not of a line of kings, but
of the families of Murray, Fleming, Gay, Whittle,
Robertson, Bolling, and Eldredge, as well as of
the branch of Randolphs to which the famous John
Randolph of Roanoke belonged.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> One cannot
leave the story of Pocahontas without recalling the
curious experiences of a feathered chieftain in her
party named Tomocomo, whom The Powhatan had
instructed to make a report on the population of
England. For this purpose he was equipped with
a sheaf of sticks on which he was to make a notch
for every white person he should meet.
Plymouth must have kept poor Tomocomo
busy enough, but on arriving in
London he uttered an amazed grunt and threw his
sticks away. He had also been instructed to observe
carefully the king and queen and God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
report on their personal appearance. Tomocomo
found it hard to believe that so puny a creature as
James Stuart could be the chief of the white men,
and he could not understand why he was not told
where God lived and taken to see him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tobacco.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Mask of Flowers.</div>

<p>When Argall arrived in Virginia, he found that
a new industry, at which sundry experiments had
been made under Dale, was acquiring large dimensions
and fast becoming established. Of all the
gifts that America has vouchsafed to the Old World,
the most widely acceptable has been that which
a Greek punster might have called "the Bacchic
gift," &#964;&#8056; &#946;&#945;&#954;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#8061;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#945;, tobacco. No other visible
and tangible product of Columbus's discovery
has been so universally diffused among all kinds
and conditions of men, even to the remotest
nooks and corners of the habitable
earth. Its serene and placid charm has everywhere
proved irresistible, although from the outset its
use has been frowned upon with an acerbity such
as no other affair of hygiene has ever called forth.
The first recorded mention of tobacco is in Columbus's
diary for November 20, 1492. The use of it
was soon introduced into the Spanish peninsula,
and about 1560 the French ambassador at Lisbon,
Jean Nicot, sent some of the fragrant herb into
France, where it was named in honour of him
Nicotiana. It seems to have been first brought to
England by Lane's returning colonists in 1586, and
early in the seventeenth century it was becoming
fashionable to smoke, in spite of the bull of Pope
Urban VIII. and King James's "Counterblast
to Tobacco." Every one will remember how that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>royal author characterized smoking as "a custom
loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful
to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the
black stinking fume thereof nearest resembling
the horrible Stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless."
On Twelfth Night, 1614, a dramatic
entertainment, got up by the gentlemen of Gray's
Inn and called the Mask of Flowers, was
performed before the king and queen at
Whitehall. In it the old classic Silenus appears,
jovial and corpulent, holding his goatskin wine-bag,
and with him a novel companion, an American
chieftain named Kawasha, dressed in an embroidered
mantle cut like tobacco leaves, with a
red cap trimmed with gold on his head, rings in
his ears, a chain of glass beads around his neck,
and a bow and arrows in his hand. These two
strange worthies discuss the merits of wine and
tobacco:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of tobacco culture.</div>

<p>In Virginia the first settlers found the Indians
cultivating tobacco in small gardens. The first
Englishman to make experiments with it is said
to have been John Rolfe in 1612. Under Yeardley's
first administration, in 1616, the cultivation
of tobacco became fairly established, and from that
time forth it was a recognized staple of the colony.
The effects of this were very notable. As the
great purchasing power of a tobacco crop
came to be generally known, the people
of Virginia devoted themselves more and
more to its cultivation, until nearly all other crops
and most other forms of industry were neglected.
Thus the type of society, as we shall hereafter see,
was largely determined by the cultivation of tobacco.
Moreover a clear and positive inducement
was now offered for emigration such as had not
existed before since the first dreams of gold and
silver were dispelled. After the first disappoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ments
it became difficult to persuade men of hard
sense to go to Virginia, and we have seen what a
wretched set of people were drawn together by the
Company's communistic schemes. But those who
came to acquire wealth by raising tobacco were of
a better sort, men of business-like ideas who knew
what they wanted and how to devote themselves
to the task of getting it. With the establishment
of tobacco culture there began a steady improvement
in the characters and fortunes of the colonists,
and the demand for their staple in Europe
soon became so great as forever to end the possibility
of perishing from want. Henceforth whatever
a Virginian needed he could buy with tobacco.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The London Company's third charter, 1612.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lotteries.</div>

<p>We have now to see how Virginia, which was
fast becoming able to support itself, became also
a self-governing community. The administrations
of Lord Delaware, of Dale, of Yeardley, and of
Argall, were all despotisms, whether mild or
harsh. To trace the evolution of free government,
we must take our start in the year 1612,
when the London Company obtained its
third charter. The immediate occasion
for taking out this charter was the desire
of the Company to include among its possessions
the Bermuda Islands, and they were now
added to Virginia. At the same time it was felt
that the government of the Company needed some
further emendation in order to give the members
more direct and continuous control over its proceedings.
It was thus provided that there should
be weekly meetings, at which not less than five
members of the council and fifteen of the Company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>must be present. Besides this there were to be
held four general courts or quarter sessions in the
course of each year, for electing the treasurer and
council and passing laws for the government of the
colony. At these quarter sessions charges could be
brought against delinquent servants of the Company,
which was clothed with full judicial powers
of hearing and deciding such cases and inflicting
punishments. A good many subscribers had been
alarmed by evil tidings from Virginia so that they
would refuse or more often would simply neglect
to pay in the amount of their subscriptions. To
remedy these evils the Company was empowered
to expel delinquent members or to bring suits in
law and equity against them to recover damages or
compel performance. Furthermore, it was allowed
to replenish its treasury by setting up lotteries, a
practice in which few people at that time saw anything
objectionable. Such a lottery was held at a
house in St. Paul's Churchyard, in July, 1612, of
which the continuator of Stow's Chronicle tells
us: "This lottery was so plainly carried
and honestly performed that it gave full
satisfaction to all persons. Thomas Sharplisse, a
tailor of London, had the chief prize, viz., 4,000
crowns in fair plate, which was sent to his house
in very stately manner. During the whole time
of the drawing of this lottery, there were always
present divers worshipful knights and esquires,
accompanied with sundry grave discreet citizens."
In September the Spanish ambassador, Zuñiga,
wrote home that "there was a lottery on foot to
raise 20,000 ducats [equivalent to about $40,000].<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
In this all the livery companies adventured. The

<div class="sidenote">The Company becomes an important force in politics.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition to the charter: Middleton's speech.</div>

<p>This remodelling of the Company's charter was
an event of political importance. Formerly the
meetings of the Company had been few and far
between, and its affairs had been practically controlled
by the council, and in many cases by its
chief executive officer, the treasurer, Sir Thomas
Smith. Now the weekly meetings of the Company,
and its courts of quarter sessions, armed
with such legislative and judicial powers, put a
new face upon things. It made the Company a
democratic self-governing body, and when we recall
the membership of the Company we
can see what this meant. There were
fifty-six of the craft-guilds or liveried
companies of the city of London, whose
lord mayor was also a prominent member, and
the political spirit of London was aggressively
liberal and opposed to high prerogative. There
were also more than a hundred London merchants
and more than two hundred persons belonging to
the nobility and gentry, including some of the
foremost peers and knights in the party hostile to
the Stuart king's pretensions. The meetings of
the Company were full of discussions which could
not help taking a political turn, since some of
the most burning political questions of the day&mdash;as,
for example, the great dispute over monopolies
and other disputes&mdash;were commercial in character.
Men's eyes were soon opened to the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>istence
of a great deliberative body outside of
Parliament and expressing itself with much freedom
on exciting topics. The social position and
weighty character of the members drew general
attention to their proceedings, especially as many
of them were also members of either the House
of Lords or the House of Commons. We can
easily believe the statement that the discussions
of the Company were followed with even deeper
interest than the debates in Parliament. It took
a few years for this aspect of the situation to become
fully developed, but opposition to the new
charter was soon manifested, even by
sundry members of the Company itself.
Some of them agreed with Sergeant
Montague that to confer such vast and
vague powers upon a mercantile corporation was
unconstitutional. In a debate in Parliament in
1614 a member of the Company named Middleton
attacked the charter on the ground that trade with
Virginia and agriculture there needed more strict
regulation than it was getting. "The shopkeepers
of London," he said, "sent over all kinds of
goods, for which they received tobacco instead of
coin, infinitely to the prejudice of the Commonwealth.
Many of the divines now smell of tobacco,
and poor men spend 4d. of their day's wages
at night in smoke. [He] wished that this patent
may be damned, and an act of Parliament passed
for the government of the colony by a company."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Martin forgets himself,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and has to apologize.</div>

<p>So much effect was produced by speeches of this
sort that the council of the Company as a counter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>stroke
presented a petition for aid, and had it
defended before the House of Commons by the
eminent lawyer, Richard Martin, one of the most
brilliant speakers of the day. Martin gave a fine
historical description of English colonizing enterprise
since Raleigh's first attempts, then he dwelt
upon the immediate and pressing needs of Virginia,
especially the need for securing an ample
reinforcement of honest workmen with their wives
and children, and he urged the propriety of a liberal
parliamentary grant in aid of the
Company and its operations. Then at
the close of an able and effective speech
his eloquence carried him away, and he so far forgot
himself as to remind the House that it had
been but a thriftless penury which had led King
Henry VII. to turn the cold shoulder upon Columbus,
and to predict for them similar chagrin if
they should neglect the interests of Virginia. This
affair, as he truly said, was of far greater importance
than many of the trifles on which the House
was in the habit of wasting its time. Poor Martin
should have stopped a minute sooner. His last
remark was heard with indignation. One member
asked if he supposed the House was a school and
he the schoolmaster; another moved that he should
be committed for contempt; finally it was decided
that he should make a public apology. So the
next day, after a mild and courteous rebuke from
the Speaker, Mr. Martin apologized as
follows, according to the brief memorandum
entered upon the journal of the House of
Commons for that day: "All men liable to err,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and he particularly so, but he was not in love with
error, and as willing as any man to be divorced
therefrom. Admits that he digressed from the
subject; that he was like a ship that cutteth the
cable and putteth to sea, for he cut his memory
and trusted to his invention. Was glad to be an
example to others, and submitted to the censure
not with a dejected countenance, for there is comfort
in acknowledging an error."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Factions within the Company.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Lord Delaware, 1618.</div>

<p>While such incidents, trifling in themselves,
tended to create prejudice against the Company
on the part of many members of Parliament,
factions were soon developed
within the Company itself. There was,
first, the division between the court party, or supporters
of the king, and the country party, opposed
to his overweening pretensions. The difference
between court and country parties was analogous
to the difference between Tories and Whigs that
began in the reign of Charles II. A second division,
crossing the first one, was that between
the defenders and opponents of the monopolies.
A third division grew out of a personal quarrel
between the treasurer, Sir Thomas Smith, and
a prominent shareholder, Lord Rich, afterwards
Earl of Warwick. This man's title remains to-day
in the name of Warwick County near the
mouth of James River. At first he and Sir
Thomas Smith were on very friendly terms. Samuel
Argall was closely connected by marriage with
Smith's family, and it was Lord Rich and his
friends who in 1617 secured Argall's appointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>as deputy-governor of Virginia. The appointment
turned out to be far from creditable. Argall's
rule was as stern as Dale's, but it was not public-spirited.
From the upright and spotless Dale
severity could be endured; with the self-seeking
and unscrupulous Argall it was quite otherwise.
He was so loudly accused of peculation and extortion
that after one year the Company sent out
Lord Delaware to take personal charge of the
colony once more. That nobleman sailed in the
spring of 1618, with 200 emigrants. They went
by way of the Azores, and while touching at the
island of St. Michael, Lord Delaware
and thirty of his companions suddenly
fell sick and died in such manner as to
raise a strong suspicion that their Spanish hosts
had poisoned them. Among the governor's private
papers was one that instructed him to arrest
Argall and send him to England for trial. When
the ship arrived in Virginia this document fell
into Argall's hands. Its first effect was to make
him behave worse than ever, until renewed complaints
of him reached England at the moment of a
great change in the governorship of the Company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quarrel between Lord Rich and Sir Thomas Smith.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Election of Sir Edwin Sandys.</div>

<p>The chief executive officer of the Company was
the treasurer. Since 1609 Sir Thomas Smith
had held that office, and it had naturally enough
become fashionable to charge all the ills
of the colony to his mismanagement.
There may have been some ground for
this. Sir Thomas was a merchant of
great public spirit and talent for business, but he
was apt to keep too many irons in the fire, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>the East India Company, of which he was governor,
absorbed his attention much more than the
affairs of Virginia. The country party, led by
such men as the Earl of Southampton, Sir Edwin
Sandys, and Nicholas Ferrar, were opposed to
Smith and twitted him with the misconduct of
Argall. At this moment broke out the quarrel
between Smith and Lord Rich. One of the merchant's
sons aged only eighteen fell madly in love
with the nobleman's young sister, Lady Isabella
Rich, and his passion was reciprocated. There
was fierce opposition to their marriage on the part
of the old merchant; and this led to an elopement
and a private wedding, at which the Earls of
Southampton and Pembroke and the Countess of
Bedford assisted.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> These leaders of the country
party thus mortally offended Sir Thomas Smith,
while between him and the young lady's brother,
Lord Rich, there was a furious explosion. Lord
Rich, who in the midst of these scenes became
Earl of Warwick, by which title posterity remembers
him, was a prominent leader of the court
party, but this family quarrel led him to a temporary
alliance with the opposition, with
the result that in the annual election for
the treasurership of the Company, in
April, 1619, Sir Thomas Smith was defeated, and
Sir Edwin Sandys chosen in his place. This victory
of the king's opponents called forth much
excitement in England; for the remaining five
years of its existence the Company was controlled
by Sandys and his friends, and its affairs were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>"administered with a degree of energy, unselfishness,
and statesmanlike wisdom, perhaps unparalleled
in the history of corporations."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir George Yeardley appointed governor of Virginia.</div>

<p>This victory in the spring election consummated
the ascendency of Sandys and his party, but that
ascendency had been already shown in
the appointment of George Yeardley to
succeed Lord Delaware as governor of
Virginia. The king can hardly have relished
this appointment, but as Yeardley was of
rather humble birth, being the son of a poor merchant
tailor, he gave him a certain sanction by
making him a knight. High official position
seemed in those days more than now to need some
such social decoration. Yeardley was ordered to
send Argall home; but that independent personage
being privately notified, it is said by the Earl
of Warwick, loaded his ship and sailed for England
before the governor's arrival. He was evidently
a man who could carry things with a bold
face. His defence of himself satisfied the court
party but not the country party; the evidence
against him seems to have reached the point of
moral conviction, but not of legal certainty; he
was put in command of a warship for the Mediterranean
service, and presently the king, perhaps
to relieve his own qualms for knighting Yeardley,
slapped him on the back and made him Sir Samuel
Argall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first American legislature, 1619.</div>

<p>On many occasions the development of popular
liberty in England has gone hand in hand
with its development in America. The growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>strength of the popular antagonism to Stuart
methods of government was first conspicuously
marked by the ascendency of Sir Edwin Sandys
and his party in Parliament and in the management
of affairs in Virginia. Its first fruit was
the introduction of parliamentary institutions
into America. Despotic government
in Virginia had been thoroughly
discredited by the conduct of Argall. More than
1,000 persons were now living in the colony, and
the year 1619 saw the number doubled.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The
people called for self-government, and Sandys believed
that only through self-government could a
colony really prosper. Governor Yeardley was
accordingly instructed to issue writs for the election
of a General Assembly in Virginia, and on
the 30th of July, 1619, the first legislative body of
Englishmen in America was called together in the
wooden church at Jamestown. Eleven local constituencies
were represented under the various designations
of <i>city</i>, <i>plantation</i>, and <i>hundred</i>; and
each constituency sent two representatives, called
<i>burgesses</i>, so that the assembly was called from
1619 until 1776 the House of Burgesses. The
eleven boroughs were James City, Charles City, the
City of Henricus, Martin Brandon, Martin's Hundred,
Lawne's Plantation, Ward's Plantation, Argall's
Gift, Flowerdieu Hundred, Smith's Hundred,
and Kecoughtan. The last two names were soon
changed. Smith's Hundred, at first named after
the treasurer, took for its sponsor one of the
opposite party and became Southampton Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>dred.
The name of this friend of Shakespeare,
somewhat curtailed, was also given to Kecoughtan,
which became Hampton, and so remains to this
day. These eleven names indicate the extent of
the colony up the James River about to seventy
miles from its mouth as the crow flies, and laterally
five or six miles inland from either bank, with
a population rather less sparse than that of Idaho
at the present day. Such was the first American
self-governing state at its beginning,&mdash;a small
beginning, but what a change from the summer
day that witnessed Lord Delaware's arrival nine
years before!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature of the General Assembly.</div>

<p>Concerning this House of Burgesses I shall have
something to say hereafter. Let it suffice for the
present to observe that along with the governor
and deputy-governor there was an appointed upper
house called the council; and that the governor,
with the assistant council, and the House of Burgesses,
altogether constituted a General
Assembly essentially similar to the General
Court of Massachusetts, to their
common prototype, the old English county court,
and to their numerous posterity, the bicameral legislatures
of nearly all the world in modern times.
The functions of this General Assembly were both
legislative and to some extent judicial. It was
endowed with full powers of legislation for the
colony. Its acts did not acquire validity until approved
by the General Court of the London Company,
but on the other hand no enactment which
the Company might make for the colony was to
be valid until approved by its General Assem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>bly.
These provisions were confirmed by a charter
issued in 1621.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first negro slaves, 1619.</div>

<p>This gift of free government to England's first
colony was the work of the London Company&mdash;or,
as it was now in London much more often
called, the Virginia Company&mdash;under the noble
management of Sir Edwin Sandys and his friends.
That great corporation was soon to perish, but its
boon to Virginia and to American liberty was to
be abiding. The story of the Company's downfall,
in its broad outlines, can be briefly told, but
first I may mention a few incidents that occurred
before the crisis. One was the first introduction
of negro slaves into Virginia, which, by
a rather curious freak of dates, came in
1619, just after the sitting of the first
free legislature, and thus furnished posterity with
a theme for moralizing. "About the last of August,"
says Secretary Rolfe, "[there] came in a
Dutch man of warre that sold us twenty negars."
A census taken five years later, however, shows
only twenty-two negroes in the colony. The increase
in their numbers was for some time very
slow, and the establishment of slave labour will
best be treated in a future chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A cargo of maidens, 1619.</div>

<p>The same year, 1619, which witnessed the introduction
of slaves and a House of Burgesses, saw
also the arrival of a shipload of young women&mdash;spinsters
carefully selected and matronized&mdash;sent
out by the Company in quest
of husbands. In Virginia, as in most
new colonies, women were greatly in the minority,
and the wise Sir Edwin Sandys understood that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
without homes and family ties a civilized community
must quickly retrograde into barbarism. On
arriving in Virginia these girls found plenty of
suitors and were entirely free to exercise their own
choice. No accepted suitor, however, could claim
his bride until he should pay the Company 120
pounds of tobacco to defray the expense of her voyage.
This practice of sending wives continued for
some time, and as homes with pleasant society grew
up in Virginia, life began to be made attractive
there and the immigration rapidly increased. By
1622 the population of Virginia was at least 4,000,
the tobacco fields were flourishing and lucrative,
durable houses had been built and made comfortable
with furniture brought from England, and
the old squalor was everywhere giving way to
thrift. The area of colonization was pushed up
the James River as far as the site of Richmond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great Indian massacre, 1622.</div>

<p>This long narrow colony was dangerously exposed
to attack from the Indian tribes along the
York and Pamunkey rivers and their confederates
to the west and north. But an Indian attack was
something that people had ceased to expect. For
eight years the Indians had been to all appearance
friendly, and it was not uncommon
to see them moving freely about the villages
and plantations. There had been
a change of leadership among them. Wahunsunakok,
the old Powhatan whom Smith called
"Father," was dead; his brother Opekankano was
now The Powhatan. It is a traditional belief that
Opekankano had always favoured hostile measures
toward the white men, and that for some years he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
awaited an opportunity for attacking them. How
much truth there may be in this view of the case
it would be hard to say; there is very little evidence
to guide us, but we may well believe that
Opekankano and his people watched with grave
concern the sudden and rapid increase of the white
strangers. That they were ready to seize upon an
occasion for war is by no means unlikely, and the
nature of the event indicates careful preparation.
Early in 1622 an Indian chief whom the English
called Jack of the Feather killed a white man
and was killed in requital. Shortly afterward a
concerted attack was made upon the colony along
the entire line from Chesapeake Bay up to the
Berkeley Plantation, near the site of Richmond,
and 347 persons were butchered. Such a destruction
of nearly nine per cent. of the white population
was a terrible blow, but the quickness with which
the colony recovered from it shows what vigorous
vitality it had been gaining under the administration
of Sir Edwin Sandys. So lately as 1618 such
a blow would have been almost prostrating, but
in 1622 the settlers turned out with grim fury
and hunted the red men like wild beasts till the
blood debt was repaid with compound interest,
and peace was restored in the land for more than
twenty years.</p>

<p>While these fiendish scenes were being enacted
in Virginia a memorable drama was moving toward
its final catastrophe in London. In the next
chapter we shall witness the overthrow of the great
Virginia Company.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="c">A SEMINARY OF SEDITION.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Summary review of the founding of Virginia.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1606-1610.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> episodes in English history are more curious
than the founding of Virginia. In the course
of the mightiest conflict the world had
witnessed between the powers of despotism
and the powers of freedom,
considerations chiefly strategical led England to
make the ocean her battle-ground, and out of
these circumstances grew the idea of establishing
military posts at sundry important strategic points
on the North American coast, to aid the operations
of the navy. In a few far-sighted minds
this idea developed into the scheme of planting
one or more Protestant states, for the increase of
England's commerce, the expansion of her political
influence, and the maintenance of her naval advantages.
After royal assistance had been sought
in vain and single-handed private enterprise had
proved unequal to the task of founding a state,
the joint-stock principle, herald of a new industrial
era, was resorted to, and we witness the
creation of two rival joint-stock companies for the
purpose of undertaking such a task. Of the two
colonies sent out by these companies, one
meets the usual fate, succumbs to famine,
and retires from the scene. The other barely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
escapes a similar fate, but is kept alive by the
energy and sagacity and good fortune of one extraordinary
man until sturdy London has invested
so much of her treasure and her life-blood in it
that she will not tamely look on and see it perish.
Then the Lord Mayor, the wealthy merchants, the
venerable craft-guilds, with many liberal knights
and peers, and a few brilliant scholars and clergymen,
turn to and remodel the London Company
into a truly great commercial corporation with an
effective government and one of London's foremost
merchant princes at its head. As if by
special intervention from heaven, the struggling
colony is rescued at the very point of death, and
soon takes on a new and more vigorous life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1610-1624.</div>

<p>But for such lavish outlay to continue, there
must be some solid return, and soon a new and
unexpected source of wealth is found.
All this sort of work is a novel experiment,
mistakes are at first made in plenty; neither
the ends to be obtained nor the methods of obtaining
them are distinctly conceived, and from the
parties of brave gentlemen in quest of El Dorado
to the crowd of rogues and pickpockets amenable
only to rough martial law, the drift of events
seems somewhat indefinite and aimless. But just
as the short-lived system of communism falls to
the ground, and private ownership of land and
earnings is established, the rapidly growing demand
for tobacco in England makes its cultivation
an abundant and steady source of wealth, the
colonists increase in numbers and are improved in
quality. Meanwhile as the interest felt by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
shareholders becomes more lively, the Company acquires
a more democratic organization. It exerts
political influence, the court party and country
party contend with each other for the control of
it, and the latter wins. Hitherto the little Virginia
colony has been, like the contemporary
French colony in Canada and like all the Spanish
colonies, a despotically governed community
closely dependent upon the source of authority in
the mother country, and without any true political
life. But now the victorious party in the Company
gives to Virginia a free representative government,
based not upon any ideal theory of the
situation, but rooted in ancient English precedent,
the result of ages of practical experience, and
therefore likely to thrive. Finally we see the
British king awakening to the fact that he has
unloosed a power that threatens danger. The
doctrine of the divine right of kings&mdash;that
ominous bequest from the half-orientalized later
Roman Empire to post-mediæval Europe&mdash;was
dear to the heart of James Stuart, and his aim in
life was to impose it upon the English people.
His chief obstacle was the country party, which if
he could not defeat in Parliament, he might at
least weaken by striking at the great corporation
that had come to be one of its strongholds. In
what we may call the embryonic development of
Virginia the final incident was the overthrow of
the London Company; but we shall see that the
severing of that umbilical cord left the colony
stronger and more self-reliant than before. In
the unfolding of these events there is poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
beauty and grandeur as the purpose of Infinite
Wisdom reveals itself in its cosmic process, slowly
but inexorably, hasting not but resting not, heedless
of the clashing aims and discordant cries of
short-sighted mortals, sweeping their tiny efforts
into its majestic current, and making all contribute
to the fulfilment of God's will.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Hostility of Spain.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gondomar and the Spanish match.</div>

<p>From the very outset the planting of Virginia
had been watched with wrath and chagrin by the
Spanish court. Within the last few years a Virginian
scholar, Alexander Brown, has collected
and published a large number of manuscript letters
and other documents preserved in the Spanish
archives at Simancas, which serve to illustrate the
situation in detail. Very little of importance
happened in London that the ambassador
Zuñiga did not promptly discover and
straightway report in cipher to Madrid. We can
now read for the first time many memoranda of
secret sessions of Philip III. and his ministers, in
which this little Protestant colony was the theme
of discussion. It was a thorn in the flesh not easy
to extract unless Spain was prepared for war with
Great Britain. At first the very weakness of the
colony served to keep this enemy's hands off; if
it was on the point of dying a natural death, as
seemed likely, it was hardly worth while to repeat
the horrors of Florida. In 1612, after Sir Thomas
Dale's administration had begun, Spain again
took the alarm; for the moment a war with England
was threatened, and if it had broken out
Virginia would have been one of the first points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
attacked. But the deaths of Lord Salisbury and
of Henry, Prince of Wales, in 1612, changed the
policy of both Philip and James. There was now
some hope of detaching the latter from Protestant
alliances, and Philip's designs upon Virginia were
subordinated to the far larger purpose of winning
back England herself into the Catholic ranks. A
plan was made for marrying the Infanta Maria to
Baby Charles, and with this end in view
one of the ablest of Spanish diplomats,
Count Gondomar (to give him at once
his best-known title), was sent as ambassador to
London. Charles was only twelve years old, and
an immediate wedding was not expected, but the
match could be kept dangling before James as a
bait, and thus his movements might be guided.
Should the marriage finally be made, Gondomar
believed that Charles could be converted to his
bride's faith, and then England might be made to
renew her allegiance to Rome. Gondomar was
mightily mistaken in the English people, but he
was not mistaken in their king. James was ready
to swallow bait, hook, and all. Gondomar completely
fascinated him,&mdash;one might almost say,
hypnotized him,&mdash;so that for the next ten years
one had but to shake that Spanish match before
him and he would follow, whatever might betide.
The official policy of England was thus often
made distasteful to Englishmen, and the sentiment
of loyalty to the sovereign was impaired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gondomar's advice to the king.</div>

<p>To Gondomar the king was in the habit of confiding
his grievances, and in 1614, after his angry
dissolution of Parliament, he said to him one day:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>"There is one thing I have here, which your king
in Spain has not, and that is a Parliament of 500
members.... I am surprised that my ancestors
should ever have permitted such an institution to
come into existence. I am a stranger and found
it here when I arrived, so I am obliged to put up
with what I cannot get rid of." Here James
stopped short and turned red in the face, at having
thus carelessly admitted his own lack
of omnipotence, whereupon the wily
Spaniard smiled and reminded him that
at all events it was only at his royal pleasure that
this very disagreeable assembly could be called
together.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> James acted on this hint, and did not
summon a Parliament again for seven years. It
is worth remembering in this connection that at
this very time the representatives of the people in
France were dismissed and not called together
again until 1789.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More advice.</div>

<p>While Parliament was not sitting, the sort of
discussion that James found so hateful was kept
up at the meetings of the London Company for
Virginia, which were commonly held at the
princely mansion of Sir Thomas Smith. Against
this corporation Gondomar dropped his sweet poison
into the king's ear. The government of colonies,
he said, is work fit only for monarchs, and
cannot safely be entrusted to a roomful of gabbling
subjects; beware of such meetings;
you will find them but "a seminary
to a seditious Parliament." Before James
had profited by these warnings, however, the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of Sir Walter Raleigh came up to absorb his attention.
A rare chance&mdash;as strange and sad as
anything that the irony of human destiny can
show&mdash;was offered for Spain to wreak her malice
upon Virginia in the person of the earliest and
most illustrious of its founders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imprisonment of Raleigh.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Raleigh released and sent to Guiana.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's treachery.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Judicial murder of Raleigh, 1618.</div>

<p>In 1603, not long after King James's arrival in
England, Raleigh had been charged with complicity
in Lord Cobham's abortive conspiracy for
getting James set aside in favour of his cousin,
Lady Arabella Stuart. This charge is
now proved to have been ill-founded;
but James already hated Raleigh with
the measure of hatred which he dealt out to so
many of Elizabeth's favourites. After a trial in
which the common-law maxim, that innocence
must be presumed until guilt is proved, was read
backward, as witches were said to read the Lord's
Prayer in summoning Old Nick, Sir Walter was
found guilty of high treason and condemned to
death. The wrath of the people was such that
James, who did not yet feel his position quite
secure, did not venture to carry out the sentence.
He contented himself with plundering Sir Walter's
estates, while the noble knight was kept for
more than twelve years a prisoner in the Tower,
where he solaced himself with experiments in
chemistry and with writing that delightful History
of the World which is one of the glories of
English prose literature. In 1616, at the intercession
of Villiers, Raleigh was set free. On his
expedition to Guiana in 1595 he had discovered
gold on the upper waters of the Caroni River in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>what is now Venezuela. In his attempt to dispense
with parliaments James was at his wits'
end for money, and he thought something might
be got by sending Raleigh back to take
possession of the place. It is true that
Spain claimed that country, but so did
James on the strength of Raleigh's own discoveries,
and if any complication should arise there
were ways of crawling out. Raleigh had misgivings
about starting on such an adventure without
first obtaining a pardon in set form; but Sir Francis
Bacon is said to have assured him that the
king, having under the privy seal made him admiral
of a fleet, with power of martial law over
sailors and officers, had substantially condoned all
offences, real or alleged. A man could not at one
and the same time be under attaint of treason and
also an admiral in active service. Before Raleigh
started James made him explain the details of his
scheme and lay down his route on a chart, and
he promised on the sacred word of a king not to
divulge this information to any human creature.
It was only the sacred word of a Stuart king.
James may have meant to keep it, but his evil
genius was not far off. The lifelike portrait of
Count Gondomar, superbly painted by the elder
Daniel Mytens, hangs in the palace at Hampton
Court, and one cannot look on it for a moment
without feeling that Mephistopheles himself must
have sat for it. The bait of the Infanta, with a
dowry of 2,000,000 crowns in hard cash, was once
more thrown successfully, and James told every
detail of Raleigh's plans to the Spaniard, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>sent the intelligence post-haste to Madrid. So
when the English fleet arrived at the mouths of
the Orinoco, a Spanish force awaited them and
attacked their exploring party. In the
fight that ensued Raleigh's son Walter
was slain; though the English were victorious, the
approaches to the gold fields were too strongly
guarded to be carried by the force at their command,
and thus the enterprise was baffled. The
gold fields remained for Spain, but with the fast
increasing paralysis of Spanish energy they were
soon neglected and forgotten; their existence was
denied and Raleigh's veracity doubted, until in
1889 they were rediscovered and identified by the
Venezuelan Inspector of Mines.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Since the expedition
was defeated by the treachery of his own
sovereign, nothing was left for the stricken admiral
but to return to England. The Spanish court
loudly clamoured for his death, on the ground that
he had undertaken a piratical excursion against a
country within Spanish jurisdiction. His wife
cleverly planned an escape to France, but a Judas
in the party arrested him and he was sent to the
Tower. The king promised Gondomar that Raleigh
should be publicly executed, either in London
or in Madrid; but on second thought the
latter would not do. To surrender him to Spain
would be to concede Spain's claim to
Guiana. Without conceding this claim
there was nothing for which to punish him.
Accordingly James in this year 1618 revived the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
old death sentence of 1603, and Spain drank a
deep draught of revenge when the hero of Cadiz
and Fayal was beheaded in the Palace Yard at
Westminster; a scene fit to have made Elizabeth
turn in her grave in the Abbey hard by. A fouler
judicial murder never stained the annals of any
country.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Company's election in 1620.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's attempt to interfere.</div>

<p>The silly king gained nothing by his vile treachery.
Popular execration in England at once set
him up in a pillory from which posterity is not
likely to take him down. The Spanish council of
state advised Philip III. to send him an autograph
letter of thanks,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but the half-promised Infanta
with her rich dowry kept receding like the grapes
from eager Tantalus. A dwindling exchequer
would soon leave James with no resource except
summoning once more that odious Parliament.
Meanwhile in the London Company for Virginia
there occurred that change of political drift whereof
the election of Sir Edwin Sandys over Sir
Thomas Smith, aided though it had been by a private
quarrel, was one chief symptom. That election
revealed the alarming growth of hostility in
the city of London to the king's pretensions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>to the court party.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> James had said just before
the election, "Choose the Devil if you
will, but not Sir Edwin Sandys." From
that time forth the king's hostility to
the Company scarcely needed Gondomar's skilful
nursing. It grew apace till it became aggressive,
not to say belligerent. At the election in 1620
it was the intention of the majority in the Company
to reëlect Sandys, with whose management
they were more than pleased. Nearly 500 members
were present at the meeting. It was the custom
for three candidates to be named and voted
for, one after another, by ballot, and a plurality
sufficed for a choice. On this occasion the name
of Sir Edwin Sandys, first of three, was about to
be put to vote, when some gentlemen of the king's
household came in and interrupted the proceedings.
The king, said their spokesman,
positively forbade the election of Sir Edwin
Sandys. His Majesty was unwilling
to infringe the rights of the Company, and would
therefore himself propose names, even as many as
four, on which a vote might be taken. The names
were forthwith read, and turned out to be those
of Sir Thomas Smith and three of his intimate
friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reading of
the charter.</div>

<p>This impudent interference was received with
a silence more eloquent than words, a profound
silence that might be felt. After some minutes
came murmurs and wrathful ejaculations, among
which such expressions as "tyranny" and "invasion
of chartered rights" could be plainly heard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>The motion was made that the king's messengers
should leave the room while the situation was discussed.
"No," said the Earl of Southampton,
"let them stay and hear what is said." This motion
prevailed. Then Sir Lawrence Hyde moved
that the charter be read, and his motion
was greeted with one of those dutiful
but ominous cries so common in that age; from
all parts of the room it resounded, "The charter!
the charter!! God save the King!" The roll of
parchment was brought forward and read aloud by
the secretary. "Mr. Chairman," said Hyde, "the
words of the charter are plain; the election of a
treasurer is left to the free choice of this Company.
His Majesty seems to labour under some
misunderstanding, and I doubt not these gentlemen
will undeceive him."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Withdrawal
of Sandys.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Election of
Southampton.</div>

<p>For a few minutes no one replied, and there
was a buzz of informal conversation about the
room, some members leaving their seats to speak
with friends not sitting near them. One of
our accounts says that some of the king's emissaries
stepped out and sought his presence, and
when he heard what was going on he looked a
little anxious and his stubbornness was somewhat
abated; he said of course he did not wish to restrict
the Company's choice to the names he had
mentioned. Whether this concession was reported
back to the meeting, we are not informed,
but probably it was. When the
meeting was called to order, Sir Robert Phillips,
who was sitting near Sandys, got up and announced
that that gentleman wished to withdraw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>his name; he would therefore propose that the
king's messengers should nominate two persons
while the Company should nominate a third. The
motion was carried, and the Company nominated
the Earl of Southampton. The balloting showed
an extremely meagre vote for the king's nominees.
It was then moved and carried that in the earl's
case the ballot should be dispensed with
and the choice signified by acclamation;
and then with thundering shouts of
"Southampton! Southampton," the meeting was
brought to a close. The rebuke to the king could
hardly have been more pointed, and in such a
scene we recognize the prophecy of the doom to
which James's wrong policy was by and by to
hasten his son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nicholas
Ferrar.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Little
Gidding.</div>

<p>The choice of Shakespeare's friend instead of
Sandys made no difference whatever in the policy
of the Company. From that time forth its ruling
spirits were Southampton and Sandys and Nicholas
Ferrar, the deputy-treasurer. The name of
this young man calls for more than a passing mention.
Better known in ecclesiastical than
in political history, he was distinguished
and memorable in whatever he undertook, and
among all the thronging figures in England's past
he is one of the most sweetly and solemnly beautiful.
His father, the elder Nicholas Ferrar, who
died in April, 1620, just before the election I have
been describing, was one of London's merchant
princes, and it was in the parlour of his hospitable
house in St. Osyth's Lane&mdash;now known as Size
Lane, near the Poultry&mdash;that the weekly meetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of the Virginia Council were in these latter days
regularly held. In this house the young Nicholas
was born in 1593. He had spent seven years in
study at Cambridge and five years in very extensive
travel upon the continent of Europe, when at
the age of twenty-seven he came to devote all his
energies for a time to the welfare of the colony of
Virginia. From early boyhood he was noticeable
for taking a grave and earnest but by no means
sombre view of life, its interests and its duties.
For him frivolity had no charm, coarse pleasures
were but loathsome, yet he was neither stern nor
cold. Through every fibre of his being he was the
refined and courteous gentleman, a true Sir Galahad
fit to have found the Holy Grail. His scholarship
was thorough and broad. An excellent
mathematician and interested in the new dawning
of physical science, he was also well versed in the
classics and in modern languages and knew something
of Oriental philology, but he was most fond
of the devotional literature of the church. His
intensely religious mood was part of the great
spiritual revival of which Puritanism was the
mightiest manifestation; yet Nicholas Ferrar was
no Puritan either in doctrine or in ecclesiastical
policy. In these matters his sympathies were
rather with William Laud. At the same time his
career is a living refutation of the common notion
that there is a necessary connection between the
religion of Laud and the politics of Strafford, for
his own political views were as liberal as those of
Hampden and Pym. Indeed Ferrar was a rare
product of the harmonious coöperation of the ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>dencies
represented respectively in the Renaissance
and in the Reformation, tendencies which
the general want of intelligence and moral soundness
in mankind has more commonly brought into
barren conflict. His ideal of life was much like
that which Milton set forth with matchless beauty
in "Il Penseroso." Its leading motive, strengthening
with his years, was the feeling of duty toward
the "studious cloister's pale," and the part of his
career that is now best remembered is the founding
of that monastic home at Little Gidding,
where study and charitable deeds
and prayer and praise should go on unceasing,
where at whatsoever hour of day or night the
weary wayfarer through the broad fen country
should climb that hilly range in Huntingdon, he
should hear the "pealing organ blow to the full-voiced
choir below," and entering should receive
spiritual comfort and strength, and go thence on
his way with heart uplifted. In that blest retreat,
ever busy with good works, lived Nicholas Ferrar
after the downfall of the great London Company
until his own early death in 1637 at the age of
forty-four. Of great or brilliant deeds according
to the world's usual standard this man did none;
yet the simple record of his life brings us into
such an atmosphere of holiness and love that mankind
can never afford to let it fade and die.</p>

<p>This Protestant saint, withal, was no vague
dreamer, but showed in action the practical sagacity
that came by inheritance from London's
best stock of bold and thrifty citizens. As one of
the directing minds of a commercial corporation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
he showed himself equal to every occasion that
arose. He is identified with the last days of the
London Company, and his family archives preserve
the record of its downfall. It is thence that
we get the account of the election of Southampton
and many other interesting scenes and important
facts that would otherwise have passed
into oblivion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disputes
in the
Company.</div>

<p>After Southampton's election the king's hostility
to the Company became deadly, and within
that corporation itself he found allies who when
once they found themselves unable to rule it were
only too willing to contribute to its ruin. Sir
Thomas Smith and his friends now accepted their
defeat as decisive and final, and allowed themselves
to become disloyal to the Company.
Probably they would have expressed
it differently; they would have
said that out of regard for Virginia they felt it
their duty to thwart the reckless men who had
gained control of her destinies. Unfortunately
for their version of the case, the friends of Sir
Thomas Smith were charged with the burden of
Argall's misdemeanours, and the regard which
that governor had shown for Virginia was too
much like the peculiar interest that a wolf feels
in the sheepfold. It is not meant that the members
of the court party who tried to screen Argall
were all unscrupulous men; such was far from
being the case, but in public contests nothing is
more common than to see men personally stainless
blindly accept and defend the rogues of their own
party. In the heat of battle the private quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
between Smith and the Earl of Warwick was
either made up or allowed to drop out of sight.
Both worked together, and in harmony with the
king, to defeat Southampton and Sandys and
Ferrar. In the Company's quarter sessions the
disputes rose so high that the meetings were said
to be more like cockpits than courts.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> On one
occasion a duel between the Earl of Warwick and
Lord Cavendish, eldest son of the first Earl of
Devonshire, was narrowly prevented. As Chamberlain,
one of the court gossips of the day, writes:
"Last week the Earl of Warwick and the Lord
Cavendish fell so foul at a Virginia ... court
that the lie passed and repassed, and they are
[gone out] to try their fortune, yet we do not hear
they are met, so that there is hope they may return
safe. In the meantime their ladies forget
not their old familiarity, but meet daily to lament
that misfortune. The factions in [the Company]
are grown so violent as Guelfs and Ghibellines
were not more animated one against another; and
they seldom meet upon the Exchange, or in the
streets, but they brabble and quarrel."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king rebuked
by
the House of
Commons.</div>

<p>In 1621 the king, having arrived at the end of
his purse, seized what he thought a favourable
moment for summoning Parliament, but found
that body more intractable than ever. The Commons
busied themselves with attacking monopolies
and impeaching the Lord Chancellor Bacon
for taking bribes. Then they expressed unqualified
disapproval of the Spanish match, whereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>the king told them to mind their own business
and not meddle with his. "A long and
angry dispute ensued, which terminated
in a strong protest, in which the Commons
declared that their privileges were not the
gift of the Crown, but the natural birthright of
English subjects, and that matters of public interest
were within their province."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This protest so
infuriated the king that he tore it into pieces, and
forthwith dissolved Parliament, sending Pym,
Southampton, and other leaders to prison. This
was in January, 1622.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nathaniel
Butler and
his pamphlet.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Some charges and
answers:</div>

<p>As more than a hundred members of this froward
Parliament were also members of the Company,
it is not strange that the king should have
watched more eagerly than ever for a chance to
attack that corporation. A favourable opportunity
was soon offered him. A certain Nathaniel Butler,
governor of the Bermuda Islands, was accused of
extorting a large sum of money from
some Spaniards who had been shipwrecked
there, and very damaging evidence
was brought against him; but he seems to
have known how to enlist powerful friends on his
side. On being summoned to England he went
first to Virginia, where his services were in demand
during the brief but bloody Indian war that
followed upon the massacre of 1622. Then after
arriving in England he published, in April, 1623,
a savage attack upon the London Company, entitled
"The Unmasked Face of our Colony in
Virginia." Simultaneously with the publication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>of this pamphlet the charges against its author
were dropped and were nevermore heard of. Such
a coincidence is extremely significant; it was commonly
believed at the time that Butler bought the
suppression of the charges by turning backbiter.
His attack upon the Company is so frivolous as
plainly to indicate its origin in pure malice. It is
interesting as the first of the long series of books
about America printed in England which have
sorely irritated their American readers. Sixteen
of the old Virginia settlers who were at
that moment in London answered it with
convincing force. Some of this Butler's
accusations, with the answers of the settlers, may
fitly be cited for the side-light they throw upon
the state of things in Virginia, as well as upon the
peculiar sinuosities of Stuart kingcraft.</p>

<div class="sidenote">as to
malaria;</div>

<p>"1. I found the plantations generally seated
upon meer salt marishes full of infectious bogs and
muddy creeks and lakes, and thereby
subjected to all those inconveniencies and
diseases which are so commonly found in the most
unsound and most unhealthy parts of England,
whereof every country and climate hath some.</p>

<p>"<i>Answer</i>: We say that there is no place inhabited
but is conveniently habitable. And for
the first plantation, which is Kiccoutan, ... men
may enjoy their healths and live as plentifully as
in any part of England, ... yet that there are
marishes in some places we acknowledge.... As
for bogs, we know of none in all the country,

the difficulty, danger, and spoil of goods

continual wading and wetting of themselves, and
that [too] in the prime of winter, when the ships
commonly arrive, and thereby get such violent
surfeits of cold upon cold as seldom leave them
until they leave [off] to live.</p>

<p>"<i>Answer</i>: That generally for the plantations at
all times from half flood to half ebb any boat that
draws betwixt 3 and 4 foot water may safely come
in and land their goods dry on shore without
wading. And for further clearing of his false
objections, the seamen ... do at all times deliver
the goods they bring to the owners dry on shore,
whereby it plainly appears not any of the country

some of them many days unregarded and unburied.</p>

<p>"<i>Answer</i>: The winter is the most healthful time
and season for arrival of new comers. True it is
that as yet there is no guest-house or place of
entertainment for strangers. But we aver it was
a late intent ... to make a general gathering for
the building of such a convenient house, which by
this time had been in good forwardness, had it not
pleased God to suffer this disaster to fall out by
the Indians. But although there be no public
guest-house, yet are new comers entertained and
lodged and provided for by the governor in private
houses. And for any dying in the fields through
this defect, and lying unburied, we are altogether
ignorant; yet that many [persons] die suddenly
by the hand of God, we often see it ... fall out
even in this flourishing and plentiful city [of
London] in the midst of our streets. As for

<p>So go the charges and the answers. It is unnecessary
to cite any further. The animus of
Captain Butler's pamphlet is sufficiently apparent.
He wished to make it appear that things were
wretchedly managed in Virginia, and that there
was but a meagre and contemptible result to show
for all the treasure that had been spent and all
the lives that had been lost. Whatever could
weaken people's faith in the colony, check emigration,
deter subscriptions, and in any way
embarrass the Company, he did not fail
to bring forward. Not only were the sites unhealthy
and the houses mean, but the fortifications
were neglected, plantations were abandoned, the
kine and poultry were destroyed by Indians, the
assembly enacted laws wilfully divergent from
the laws of England, and speculators kept engross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>ing
wheat and maize and selling them at famine
prices; so said Butler, and knowing how effective
a bold sweeping lie is sure to be, in spite of prompt
and abundant refutation, he ended by declaring
that not less than 10,000 persons had been sent
out to Virginia, of whom "through the aforenamed
abuses and neglects" not more than 2,000
still remained alive. Therefore, he added, unless
the dishonest practices of the Company in London
and the wretched bungling of its officials in Virginia
be speedily redressed "by some divine and
supreme hand, ... instead of a Plantation it will
shortly get the name of a slaughter house, and
[will] justly become both odious to ourselves and
contemptible to all the world."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The assembly denies the allegations.</div>

<p>All these allegations were either denied or satisfactorily
explained by the sixteen settlers then
in London, and their sixteen affidavits
were duly sworn to before a notary public.
Some months afterward, Captain
Butler's pamphlet was laid before the assembly of
Virginia and elaborately refuted. Nothing can be
clearer than the fact that the sympathies of the
people in Virginia were entirely on the side of the
Company under its present management, and no
fact could be more honourable to the Company.
From first to last the proceedings now to be related
were watched in Virginia with intense anxiety
and fierce indignation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An answer demanded of Ferrar.</div>

<p>On Thursday of Holy Week, 1623, a formal
complaint against the Company, embodying such
charges as those I have here recounted, was laid
before the Privy Council, and the Lord Treasurer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>Cranfield, better known as Earl of Middlesex, sent
notice of it to Nicholas Ferrar, with the
demand that a complete answer to every
particular should be returned by the next
Monday afternoon. Ferrar protested against such
unseemly haste, but the Lord Treasurer was inexorable.
Then the young man called together as
many of the Company as he could find at an
hour's notice that afternoon; they met in his
mother's parlour, and he read aloud the complaint,
which took three hours. Then Lord Cavendish,
Sir Edwin Sandys, and Nicholas Ferrar
were appointed a committee to prepare the answer.
"These three," says our chronicle, "made it midnight
ere they parted; they ate no set meals; they
slept not two hours all Thursday and Friday
nights; they met to admire each other's labours
on Saturday night, and sat in judgment on the
whole till five o'clock on Sunday morning; then
they divided it equally among six nimble scribes,
and went to bed themselves, as it was high time
for them. The transcribers finished by five o'clock
Monday morning; the Company met at six to
review their labours, and by two in the afternoon
the answer was presented at the Council Board."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A cogent answer is returned.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts to corrupt Ferrar.</div>

<p>This answer was a masterpiece of cogency. It
proved the baselessness of the charges. Either
they were complete falsehoods, or they related to
disasters directly connected with the Indian
massacre, which was not due to any
provocation on the part of the whites, or
else they showed the effects of mismanagement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Sir Thomas Smith's time, especially under the
tyrannical administration of Argall from which
the colony had not yet fully recovered. In short,
such of the charges as really bore against the
Company were successfully shown up as affecting
its old government under Smith and Warwick,
and not its new government under Sandys and
Southampton. The latter was cleared of every
calumny, and its absolute integrity and vast efficiency
were fully established. Such, at least, is
the decisive verdict of history, but the lords of the
Privy Council were not willing to accept such a
result. It amounted almost to an impeachment of
the court party, and it made them angry. So the
Earl of Warwick succeeded in obtaining an order
that Lord Cavendish, Sir Edwin Sandys, and Rev.
Nicholas Ferrar,&mdash;as "chief actors in inditing
and penning ... an impertinent declaration containing
bitter invectives and aspersions" should
be confined to their own houses until further
notice.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The object of this was to prevent them
from conferring with each other. Further hostile
inquiries were prosecuted, and an attempt was
made to detach Ferrar from his associates. One
day, as he was answering some queries before the
Privy Council, one of the lords handed him an
important official letter to the governor of Virginia.
"Who draws up such papers?" asked the
lord. "The Company," replied Ferrar modestly.
"No, no!" interrupted another lord, "we know
your style; these papers are all yours, and they
are masterpieces." The letter was shown to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
king, who was pleased to observe, "Verily, the
young man hath much worth in him." To detach
him from the Company the king offered to make
him clerk of the Privy Council or ambassador
to the court of Savoy. Both were
fine offers for a man only in his thirtieth
year, but Ferrar was not to be tempted. Then an
effort was made to induce him to advise the Company
to surrender its charter, but he refused with
some scorn. A great number of the nobility and
gentry, he said, besides merchants and artisans of
the city of London, relying upon the royal charter,
had engaged in a noble enterprise, one of the most
honourable that England had ever undertaken;
many planters in Virginia had risked their estates
and lives in it; the Lord had prospered their endeavours,
and now no danger threatened the colony
save the malice of its enemies; as for himself
he was not going to abuse his trust by deserting it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A board of commissioners.</div>

<p>While these things were going on, the king
appointed a board of commissioners to investigate
the affairs of Virginia, and the spirit in which they
were appointed is sufficiently revealed by the fact
that they all belonged to the disaffected faction in
the Company and held their meetings at the house
of Sir Thomas Smith. One of their number was
the vindictive and unscrupulous ex-governor,
Sir Samuel Argall,&mdash;which was
much like setting the wolf to investigate
the dogs. Some of these commissioners went out
to Virginia and tried to entrap the assembly into
asking for a new charter. It was all in vain.
Governor, council, and House of Burgesses agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
that they were perfectly satisfied with the present
state of things and only wanted to be let alone.
Not a morsel of evidence adverse to the present
management of the Company could be obtained
from any quarter. On the contrary, the assembly
sent to England an eloquent appeal, afterward
entitled "The Tragical Declaration of the Virginia
Assembly," in which the early sufferings of
the colony and its recent prosperity were passed in
review; the document concluded with an expression
rather more forcible than one is accustomed
to find in decorous and formal state papers. After
describing the kind of management under which
such creatures as Argall could flourish, the document
goes on to say, "Rather [than] be reduced
to live under the like government, we desire his
Majesty that commissioners may be sent over with
authority to hang us."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attorney-general's opinion; a <i>quo warranto</i> served.</div>

<p>Long before this appeal reached England, the
final assault upon the Company had begun. In
July, 1623, the attorney-general reported
his opinion that it was advisable for the
king to take the government of Virginia
into his own hands. In October an order
of the Privy Council announced that this was to
be done. The Company's charter was to be rescinded,
and its deputed powers of sovereignty
were to be resumed by the king. This meant that
the king would thereafter appoint the council for
Virginia sitting in London. He would also appoint
the governor of Virginia with his colonial
council. Such a transformation would leave the
joint-stock company in existence, but only as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
body of traders without ascertained rights or privileges
and entirely dependent upon royal favour.
No settled policy could thereafter be pursued, and
under the circumstances the change was a deathblow
to the Company. Southampton and Ferrar
refused to surrender, and referred the question to
their next quarter-sessions to be held in November.
Then the king brought suit against the Company
in the court of King's Bench, and a writ of <i>quo
warranto</i> was served.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appeal to Parliament.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king refuses to allow the appeal.</div>

<p>Then came the most interesting moment of all.
The only hope of the Company lay in an appeal
to Parliament, and that last card was
boldly played. Early in 1624 the Spanish
match, to secure which the miserable king had
for ten years basely truckled and licked the hand
of England's bitterest enemies, was finally broken
off. War with Spain was at hand; a new policy,
of helping the German Protestants, and marrying
Baby Charles to a French princess, was to be considered;
and much money was needed. So James
reluctantly issued writs for an election, and the
new Parliament, containing Sandys and Ferrar,
with many other members of the Virginia Company,
met in February. In April a petition was
presented in behalf of the Virginia Company, and
a committee had been appointed to consider it,
when the Speaker read a message from the king,
forbidding Parliament to meddle with the matter.
He distinctly announced the doctrine that
the government of colonies was the business
of king and his Privy Council,
and that Parliament had nothing to do with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
This memorable doctrine was just that which afterwards
found favour with the American colonists
for very different reasons from those which recommended
it to King James. The Americans took
this view because they were not represented in
Parliament, and intended with their colonial assemblies
to hold the crown officials, the royal governors,
in check just as Parliament curbed the
Crown. By the middle of the eighteenth century
this had come to be the generally accepted American
doctrine; it is interesting to see it asserted
early in the seventeenth by the Crown itself, and
in the interests of absolutism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attorney-general's argument.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The charter annulled, June 16, 1624.</div>

<p>In 1624 Parliament was not in good condition
for quarrelling with the king upon too many issues
at once. So it acquiesced, not without
some grumbling, in the royal prohibition,
and the petition of the Virginia Company
was laid upon the table. A few weeks later
the case on the <i>quo warranto</i> was argued before
the court of King's Bench. The attorney-general's
argument against the charter was truly ingenious.
That charter allowed the Company to carry the
king's subjects across the ocean to Virginia; if
such a privilege were to be exercised without limitation,
it might end in conveying all the king's
subjects to America, leaving Great Britain a
howling wilderness! Such a privilege was too
great to be bestowed upon any corporate body,
and therefore the charter ought to be
annulled. Such logic was irresistible,
and on the 16th of June the chief justice
declared "that the Patent or Charter of the Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>pany
of English Merchants trading to Virginia,
and pretending to exercise a power and authority
over his Majesty's good subjects there, should
be thenceforth null and void." Next day Thomas
Wentworth, afterward Earl of Strafford, gave
vent to his glee in a private letter: "Methinks, I
imagine the Quaternity before this have had a
meeting of comfort and consolation, stirring up
each other to bear it courageously, and Sir Edwin
Sandys in the midst of them sadly sighing forth,
Oh, the burden of Virginia." By the Quaternity
he meant Southampton, Sandys, Ferrar, and Cavendish.
On the 26th of June the Privy Council
ordered Nicholas Ferrar to bring all the books
and papers of the late Company and hand them
over to its custody.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ferrar has the records copied.</div>

<div class="sidenote">History of a manuscript.</div>

<p>Ferrar could not disobey the order, but he had
made up his mind that the records of the Company
must be preserved, for its justification
in the eyes of posterity. As soon
as he saw that the day of doom was at
hand he had copies made. One of Ferrar's dearest
friends was the delightful poet, George Herbert,
a young man of his own age, whose widowed
mother had married Sir John Danvers, a prominent
member of the Company. They lived in a
fine old house in Chelsea, that had once been part
of the home of Sir Thomas More. There Nicholas
Ferrar passed many a pleasant evening with
George Herbert and his eccentric and skeptical
brother, afterward Lord Herbert of Cherbury;
and if ever their talk grew a bit too earnest and
warm, we can fancy it mellowed again as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>other sweet poet, Dr. Donne, dropped in, with
gentle Izaak Walton, as used often to happen. In
that house of friends, Ferrar had a clerk locked
up with the records until they were all copied,
everything relating to the administrations of Sandys
and Southampton, from the election of the
former, in April, 1619, down to June 7, 1624.
The copy was then carefully compared with the
original documents, and its perfect accuracy duly
attested by the Company's secretary, Edward Collingwood.
Sir John Danvers then carried the
manuscript to the Earl of Southampton, who exclaimed,
as he threw his arms about his neck,
"God bless you, Danvers! I shall keep this with
my title-deeds at Tichfield; it is the evidence of
my honour, and I prize it more than the evidence
of my lands." About four months afterward
Southampton died. Forty-three years
afterward, in 1667, his son and successor
passed away, and then this precious manuscript
was bought from the executors by William Byrd,
of Virginia, father of the famous historian and
antiquary. From the Byrd library it passed into
the hands of William Stith, president of William
and Mary College, who used it in writing his History
of Virginia, published at Williamsburg in
1747, one of the most admirable of American historical
works. From Stith's hands the manuscript
passed to his kinsman, Peyton Randolph,
president of the Continental Congress, and after
his death in 1775, Thomas Jefferson bought it.
In 1814 ex-president Jefferson sold his library
to the United States, and this manuscript is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in the Library of Congress, 741 folio pages bound
in two volumes. As for the original documents,
they are nowhere to be found among British
records; and when we recollect how welcome their
destruction must have been to Sir Thomas Smith,
to the Earl of Warwick, and to James I., we cannot
help feeling that the chest of the Privy Council
was not altogether a safe place in which to
keep them.</p>

<p>It is to the copy preserved through the careful
forethought of Nicholas Ferrar that we owe our
knowledge of one of the most interesting chapters
in early American history. In the development
of Virginia the overthrow of the great London
Company was an event of cardinal importance.
For the moment it was quite naturally bewailed in
Virginia as a direful calamity; but, as we shall
presently see, it turned out to be a blessing in
disguise. Stuart despotism gained not one of its
ends, except the momentary gratification of spleen,
and self-government in Virginia, which seemed in
peril, went on to take root more deeply and
strongly than before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="c">THE KINGDOM OF VIRGINIA.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Retrospect.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Tidewater Virginia.</div>

<p>From the busy streets of London, from the
strife in Parliament and the Privy Council, we
must turn once more to the American wilderness
and observe what progress had been made in Virginia
during the seventeen years of its
government by a great joint-stock company.
But for a correct appreciation of the situation
we must qualify and limit this period of
seventeen years. The terrible experience of the
first three years left the colony at the point of
death, and it was not until the administration of
Sir Thomas Dale that any considerable expansion
beyond Jamestown began. The progress visible
in 1624 was mostly an affair of ten years' duration,
dating from the abolition of communism and the
beginnings of tobacco culture. By far the greater
part of this progress had been achieved within the
last five years, since the establishment of self-government
and the greater part played by family
life. In 1624 the colony of Virginia extended
from the mouth of James River up nearly as far
as the site of Richmond, with plantations on both
banks; and it spread over the peninsula between
the James and the broad stream next to the north
of it, which at that time was called the Charles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>but since 1642 has been known as the York River.
There were also a few settlements on the Accomac
peninsula east of Chesapeake Bay. It would be
hard to find elsewhere upon the North American
coast any region where the land is so generally
and easily penetrable by streams that can be
navigated. The country known as "tidewater
Virginia" is a kind of sylvan Venice.
Into the depths of the shaggy woodland
for many miles on either side the great bay the
salt tide ebbs and flows. One can go surprisingly
far inland on sea-faring craft, while with a boat
there are but few plantations on the old York
peninsula to which one cannot approach very
near. In the absence of good roads this ubiquity
of navigable water was a great convenience, but
doubtless the very convenience of it may have
delayed the arduous work of breaking good land-routes
through the wilderness, and thus have
tended to maintain the partial isolation of the
planters' estates, to which so many characteristic
features of life in Old Virginia may be traced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Receding frontier.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The plantations.</div>

<p>If in 1624 we had gone up stream to Werowocomoco,
where Smith had broken the ice with
his barge fifteen years before, we should probably
have found very little of its strange barbaric
life remaining. The first backward step of
the Indian before the encroaching progress of
Englishmen had been taken. The frontier was
fast receding to the Pamunkey region
along the line joining the site of West
Point with that of Cold Harbor; and from that
time forward a perpetually receding frontier of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>barbarism was to be one of the most profoundly
and variously significant factors in the life of
English-speaking America until the census of 1890
should announce that such a frontier could no
longer be definitely located. In the last year of
James I. the grim Opekankano and his warriors
still held the Pamunkey River; in that neighbourhood
and to the north of it one might have
seen symptoms of the wild frontier life of the
white hunter and trapper. Returning thence to
the great bay, the plantation called Dale's Gift on
the Accomac shore would have little about it that
need detain us, and so sweeping across from Cape
Charles to Point Comfort, we should come to
Elizabeth City, named for King James's daughter
Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia. The only plantation
here, standing like a sentinel to guard the
principal avenue into the colony, bears the name
of the last treasurer of the Company, curtailed into
Hampton. The next borough bears the
name of Southampton's enemy, the Earl
of Warwick, and opposite are the plantations on
Warrasqueak Bay. Passing Jamestown, we arrive
at the mouth of the Chickahominy, above which
lies an extensive territory known as Charles City,
with the plantations of Wyanoke and Westover,
while over on the south side of the James the settlements
known as Martin Brandon, Flowerdieu
Hundred, and Bermuda successively come into
sight and disappear. Then we sail around the
City of Henricus, and passing the ruins of Falling
Creek, destroyed by the Indians, we come at
length to the charming place that Smith called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Nonesuch. Here, a few miles below the spot
where Richmond is in future to stand, we reach
once more the frontier. Beyond are endless
stretches of tangled and mysterious woods through
which the sturdy Newport once vainly tried to find
his way to some stream flowing into the Pacific
Ocean. Here we may turn our prow and make
our way down to Jamestown, where the House of
Burgesses is in session.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boroughs and burgesses.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Boroughs and hundreds.</div>

<p>It is called a House of Burgesses because its
members are regarded as the representatives of
boroughs, and such a name sounds queer
as applied to little areas of scattered
farms in the forest. Still more strange is
the epithet "city" for tracts of woodland several
miles in extent, and containing half a dozen widely
isolated plantations. The apparent absurdity is
emphasized on the modern map, where such names
as Charles City and James City are simply names
of counties. How came such names first to be
used in such senses? One's mind naturally reverts
to what goes on to-day in the Far West, where
geographical names, like doubtful promissory
notes, must usually be taken with heavy discount
for an uncertain future, where in every such appellation
there lurks the hope of a boom, and any
collection of three or four log-cabins, with a saw-mill
and whiskey-shop, surrounded by a dozen
acres of blackened tree-stumps, may forthwith
appear in the Postal Guide under some such title
as Chain Lightning City. In oldest Virginia we
may perhaps see marks of such a spirit of buoyant
confidence in such names as Charles City or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>City of Henricus. No doubt Sir Thomas Dale,
when he fortified the little Dutch Gap peninsula
and marked out its streets, believed himself to
be founding a true city with urban destinies awaiting
it. This explanation, however, does not cover
the whole case. Whatever the title of each individual
settlement in oldest Virginia,&mdash;whether
plantation, or hundred, or city,&mdash;all were alike
conceived, for legal and political purposes, as
equivalent to boroughs, although they were not
thus designated. Now the primary meaning of
the word "borough" is "fortress," and in early
English usage a borough was a small and thickly
peopled hundred surrounded by a durable wall.
A "hundred" was a small aggregation
of townships united by a common responsibility
for the good behaviour of
its people; it was therefore the smallest area for
the administration of justice, the smallest social
community which possessed a court. Ordinarily
the hundred was a rural community, but that
special compact and fortified form of it known
as the borough retained all the legal features
of the ordinary hundred; it had its own court,
and was responsible for its own malefactors and
vagrants. In old English boroughs the responsible
men&mdash;those who owned property, and paid
taxes, and chose representatives&mdash;were the burgesses.
Bearing always in mind this equivalence
between the borough and the hundred, we may
note further that in early times the hundred was
a unit for military purposes; it was about such a
community as could furnish to the general levy a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
company of a hundred armed men. It was also a
unit of representation in the ancient English shire-moot
or county court. Now in oldest Virginia
the colonial assembly, when instituted in 1619, the
earliest legislature of civilized men in the western
hemisphere, was patterned after the old English
county court, and it was natural that its units
should be conceived as hundreds and in some instances
called so. Moreover, there are indications
that at times the hundred was regarded as a
military division, and also as the smallest area for
the administration of justice, as in the law passed
in 1624 providing that Charles City and Elizabeth
City should hold monthly courts.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Whatever
names the early settlers of Virginia gave to
their settlements individually, they seem to have
regarded them all in the legal light of hundreds,
and as they were familiar with the practical equivalence
of the borough as a unit for judicial and
representative purposes, it was natural that when
they came to choose a general assembly they
should speak of its members as if they were representatives
of boroughs. They were familiar with
burgesses in England, but the designations "hundred-men"
and "hundred-elders" had become
obsolete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The houses.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Labourers.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Indians.</div>

<p>Resuming our pilgrimage through the Virginia
of 1624, we find no walls of massive masonry with
frowning turrets encompassing these rudimentary
boroughs, but at the most exposed points we meet
with stout wooden blockhouses and here and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>a row of palisades. At some places there are
wharves for the convenient shipping of tobacco, but
now and then, if the tide is not just right, we may
be in danger of wetting our feet in going ashore,
about which that ill-disposed Captain Butler has
lately made so much fuss. The wooden frame
houses, having been built without regard
to æsthetic effects, with beams here and
there roughly hewn and boards not always smoothly
planed, are not so attractive in outward appearance
as they might be, but they are roomy and
well-aired, and the settlers already point to them
with some degree of pride as more comfortable
than the houses of labouring men in England.
These houses usually stand at wide intervals, and
nowhere, perhaps, except at Henricus and Jamestown,
would one see them clustering in a village
with streets. Here and there one might come across
a handsomer and more finished mansion, like an
English manor house, with cabins for servants
and farm buildings at some distance. Of negroes
scarcely any are to be seen, only twenty-two all
told, in this population of perhaps 4,000 souls.
Cheap labour is supplied by white servants,
bound to their masters by indentures
for some such term as six or seven years;
they are to some extent a shiftless and degraded
set of creatures gathered from the slums and jails
of English seaport towns, but many of them are
of a better sort. Of red men, since the
dreadful massacre of two years ago, one

Pocahontas is at an end, and no more can white
men be called Powhatans. On this point the
statute book speaks in no uncertain tones: "Ffor
the Indians we hould them our irrecosileable enimies,"
and it is thought fit that if any of them be
found molesting cattle or lurking about any plantation,
"then the commander shall have power by
virtue of this act to rayse a sufficient partie and
fall out uppon them, and persecute them as he
shall finde occasion."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Agriculture, etc.</div>

<p>In the plantations, thus freed from the presence
of Indians, European domestic animals have become
plenty. Horses, indeed, are not yet so much
in demand as boats and canoes, but oxen draw the
plough, the cows are milked night and
morning, sheep and goats browse here
and there, pigs and chickens are innumerable.
Pigeons coo from the eves, and occasionally one
comes upon a row of murmurous bee-hives. The
broad clearings are mostly covered with the cabbage-like
tobacco plant, but there are also many
fields of waving wheat and barley, and many
more of the tasselled Indian corn. John Smith's
scheme for manufacturing glass and soap has
not yet been abandoned; the few workmen from
Poland, brought here by him, have remained, or
else others have come in place of them, for we
find the House of Burgesses passing a statute admitting
them to the franchise and other privileges
of English citizenship, because of their value to
the commonwealth in these branches of industry.
Skilled workmen of another sort have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
sent over by Nicholas Ferrar from France, for
since mulberries grow in Virginia it has been
thought that silk-worms might be profitably raised
here, but such hopes are not destined to be realized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tobacco.</div>

<p>Such was the outward aspect of things along the
banks of the James River in the year when, amid
general grief and forebodings, the London Company
was dissolved; and such it continued to be
for many a year to come, save that the cultivated
area increased in extent and the settlers in number,
and that in spite of divers efforts to check it,
the raising of tobacco encroached more
and more upon all other forms of industry,
tending to crush them out of existence, while
at the same time the plantations grew larger and
the demand for cheap labour was vastly increased.
For some time the cultivation of Indian corn
assumed considerable proportions, so that not only
was there enough for home consumption, but in
1634 more than ten thousand bushels were exported
to Winthrop's new colony on Massachusetts
Bay. Nevertheless the encroachments of tobacco
went on without cessation, until the features of
social life in old Virginia came to be those of a
wealthy and powerful community economically
based upon one single form of agricultural industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Literature.</div>

<p>In the Virginia of 1624 one could not look for
any highly developed forms of social recreation, or
for means of education or literary attainment.
Various episodes of farm work, such as the harvesting
of the crops, or now and then the raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>of the frame of a house or barn, seem to have
been occasions for a gathering of neighbours with
some sort of merrymaking, very much as in other
primitive rural communities. Among the leading
colonists were men of university education who
brought with them literary tastes, and in their
houses might have been found ponderous tomes of
controversial theology, as well as those little thin
quarto tracts of political discussion that nowadays
often fetch such fabulous prices.
Captain John Smith was spending his
last years quietly in England, making maps and
writing or editing books. His "General History
of Virginia," published in 1624, can hardly fail to
have been read with interest in the colony; and
the same ship that brought it may well have
brought the first folio edition of Shakespeare's
complete works, which came from the press in the
preceding year. Literary production of a certain
sort went on in the colony. Such tracts as Ralph
Hamor's "True Discourse" and Whitaker's
"Good News from Virginia," though books of
rare interest and value, will perhaps hardly come
under the category of pure literature. But the
translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses by George
Sandys, youngest brother of Sir Edwin, has been
well known and admired by scholars from that
time to our own. George Sandys came to Virginia
in 1621 as treasurer of the colony, fortified
with some rather dull verses from the poet laureate,
Michael Drayton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>On the bank of James River the worthy George
entreated the Muses with success and wrote the
greater part of his poetical version, which was
published at London in 1626.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Project for a university.</div>

<p>But the Muses could not be enticed to stay long
in Virginia without some provision for higher
education there, and this was well understood
by Sir Edwin Sandys and the
enlightened gentlemen who supported him. In
1621 the Company resolved that funds should be
appropriated "for the erecting of a public free
school ... for the education of children and
grounding of them in the principles of religion.
Civility of life and humane learning," said the
committee's report, "seemed to carry with it the
greatest weight and highest consequence unto the
plantations as that whereof both Church and Commonwealth
take their original foundation and
happy estate, this being also like[ly] to prove a
work most acceptable unto the planters, through
want whereof they have been hitherto constrained
to their great costs to send their children from
thence hither to be taught." Rev. Patrick Copeland,
a missionary returning from the East Indies,
raised £70 toward the endowment of this school,
and was busily engaged in doing more for it. It
was accordingly called the East India School, it
was to be established in Charles City,
and its courses of study were to be preparatory
to those of a university which was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
set up in the city of Henricus. Great interest
was felt in this university. Like Harvard College,
founded somewhat later, it was designed not
only for the education of white youths but also for
civilizing and missionary work among the Indians.
The Bishop of London raised by subscription
£1,000 for the enterprise; one anonymous benefactor
gave a silver communion service; another,
who signed himself "Dust and Ashes," sent £550,
and promised, after certain progress should have
been made, to add £450 more; this man was afterward
discovered to be a member of the Company,
named Gabriel Barber. The elder Nicholas Ferrar
left £300 in his will, and various contributions
were added by his sons. A tract of land in
Henricus was appropriated for the site of the college,
and George Thorpe was sent out to be its
rector, or, as we should say, its president. But
Thorpe, as well as others who were interested in
the enterprise, perished in the Indian massacre of
1622. It seems that Copeland was about to be
sent to take his place, and the enterprise was
about to be vigorously pushed on by Ferrar and
his friends, when the overthrow of the Company
took away all control over Virginian affairs from
the people most interested in this work. So the
scheme for a college remained in a state of suspended
vitality for seventy years, until Dr. Blair
revived it in 1692, and established it in the town
of Williamsburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Puritans and Liberal Churchmen.</div>

<p>Everybody knows that the college of William
and Mary is the oldest in the United States, after
Harvard. It is not so generally known that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>former was planned and all but established in
1622, eight years before Winthrop and his followers
came to Massachusetts Bay. It is a just and
wholesome pride that New England people feel in
recalling the circumstances under which Harvard
College was founded, in a little colony
but six years of age, still struggling
against the perils of the wilderness and
the enmity of its sovereign. Such an event is quite
properly cited in illustration of the lofty aims
and intelligent foresight of the founders of Massachusetts.
But it should not be forgotten that
aims equally lofty and foresight equally intelligent
were shown by the men who from 1619 to 1624
controlled the affairs of Virginia. One of the
noblest features in the great Puritan movement
was its zeal for education, elementary education
for everybody and higher education for all who
could avail themselves of it. It is important to
remember that this zeal for education, as well as
the zeal for political liberty, was not confined to
the Puritans. Within the established Church of
England and never feeling a desire to leave it,
were eminent men who to the political principles
of Pym joined a faith in education as strong as
Locke's. The general temper of these men, of
whom Richard Hooker was the illustrious master,
was broadly tolerant. Sir Edwin Sandys was
friendly to the Leyden Pilgrims, and it was under
his administration that the Virginia Company
granted them the patent under which they would
have founded their colony on the coast of New
Jersey or Delaware, had not foul weather driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the Mayflower to Cape Cod. It was Sandys and
Nicholas Ferrar that were most energetic in the
attempt to found a college in Virginia, and there
were some curious points of resemblance between
their situation in 1622 and the situation of Winthrop
and his friends while they were laying the
foundations of Harvard College. In 1622, while
James I. was plotting the overthrow of the London
Company, the horrors of Indian massacre, as
sudden as lightning from a cloudless sky, fell upon
the people of Virginia. In 1637 the people of
Massachusetts had the Pequot war on their hands,
and Charles I. was plotting the overthrow of the
Company of Massachusetts Bay, against whose
charter he was on the point of issuing a writ of
<i>quo warranto</i>, when in St. Giles's church at Edinburgh
one Sunday old Jenny Geddes threw her
camp-stool at the bishop's head, and in the ensuing
turmoil American affairs were quite forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Massachusetts and Virginia.</div>

<p>The comparison reminds us that the Company
of Massachusetts Bay knew how to profit by the
fate of its great predecessor, the London Company
for Virginia. In the summer of 1629,
when things were looking very dark in
England, the leaders of the Massachusetts
Bay Company held a meeting at Cambridge
and decided to carry their company, with its charter,
across the ocean to New England, where they
might work out their purposes without so much
danger from royal interference. This transfer of
the Company to America was the most fundamental
circumstance in the early history of New
England. The mere physical fact of distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
transformed the commercial company into a self-governing
republic, which for more than fifty
years managed its own affairs in almost entire
independence of the British government. Difficulty
of access and infrequency of communication
were the safeguards of the Massachusetts Bay
Company. If it had held its meetings and promulgated
its measures in London, its life would
not have been worth a five years purchase. It had
the fate of the Virginia Company for a warning,
and most adroitly did it profit by the lesson. If
the Virginia Company could have been transferred
bodily to America in 1620, it might perhaps have
become similarly changed into a self-governing
semi-independent republic; the interests of the
Company would have been permanently identified
with those of the colony, and the course of Virginian
history might have been profoundly affected.
As it was, Virginia attained through the fall of
the Company to such measure of self-government
as it had throughout the colonial period, a self-government
much like that of Massachusetts after
1692, but far less complete than that of Massachusetts
before 1684.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of James I.</div>

<p>It was not the intention of James I. that the
overthrow of the Company should contribute in
any way to increase the liberties of the colony of
Virginia. All colonizable territory claimed by
Great Britain was, in his opinion, just so much
royal domain, something which came to him by
inheritance like the barony of Renfrew or the
manor of Windsor; it was his to do what he liked
with it, and for settlers in such territory no better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>law was needed than such as he could make for
them himself. A shadow of doubt as to
his own omniscience was never one of
James's weaknesses, and no sooner had the Company's
charter been annulled than he set himself
to work to draw up a constitution for Virginia. It
was work of a sort that he thoroughly enjoyed, but
what might have come of it will never be known,
for while he was busy with it there came upon
him what the doctors called a tertian ague, which
carried him off in March, 1625.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the downfall of the Company.</div>

<p>In the history of England no era is marked by
the accession of Charles I. In its policy and
methods, and in the political problems at issue,
his reign was merely the continuation of his
father's. But in the history of Virginia his accession
marks an important era. For if James had
lived to complete his constitution for Virginia he
would in all probability have swept away the representative
government introduced by Sir Edwin
Sandys; but Charles allowed it to stand. As
the situation was left by the death of James, so
it remained without essential change until 1776.
The House of Burgesses was undisturbed, but the
governor and council were thenceforth appointed
by the crown. The colony was thus left
less independent than it would have been
if the Company, with its power of electing
its own executive officers, could have been
transferred bodily to Virginia; but it was left
more independent than it would have been if the
existence of the Company had been continued in
London. The change from governors appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
by the Company to governors appointed by the
crown was a relaxation of the supervision which
England exercised over Virginia. For the Company
could devote all its attention to the affairs of
the colony, but the crown could not. Especially
in such reigns as those of the two Charleses, the
attention of the crown was too much absorbed
with affairs in Great Britain to allow it to interfere
decisively with the course of events in Virginia.
The colony was thus in the main thrown
back upon its own resources, and such a state
of things was most favourable to its wholesome
development. The Company, after all, was a
commercial corporation, and the main object of its
existence was to earn money for its shareholders.
The pursuit of that object was by no means always
sure to coincide with the best interests of the
colony. Moreover, although the government of
the Company from 1619 to 1624 was conducted
with energy and sagacity, disinterestedness, honesty,
and breadth of view such as history has seldom
seen rivalled, yet there was no likelihood that
such would always be the case. Such a combination
of men in responsible positions as Southampton
and Sandys and Ferrar is too rare to be
counted upon. The Company might have passed
for a weary while under the control of incompetent
or unscrupulous men, and to a young
colony like Virginia such a contingency would
have been not only disagreeable but positively
dangerous. No community, indeed, can long
afford to have its affairs administered by a body
of men so far away as to be out of immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
touch with it. On the other hand, even if we
could suppose a commercial company to go on
year after year managing a colony with so much
intelligence and sympathy as the London Company
showed in its last days, such a situation
would not be permanently wholesome for the colony.
What men need is not fostering or coddling,
but the chance to give free play to their individual
capacities. If coddling and fostering could make
a colony thrive, the French in Canada ought to
have dominated North America. From all points
of view, therefore, it seems to have been well for
Virginia that the Company fell when it did. It
established self-government there, set its machinery
successfully to work, and then vanished from
the scene, like the Jinni in some Oriental tale,
leaving its good gift behind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The virus of liberty.</div>

<p>The boon of self-government was so congenial
to the temper of the Virginians that they would
doubtless have contrived somehow to obtain it
sooner or later. Hutchinson tells us that when
the second American house of representatives was
instituted, namely, that of Massachusetts Bay in
1634, the people were well aware that no provision
for anything of the sort had been made in
of their charter, but they assumed that the
right to such representation was implied
by that clause of the charter which reserved to
them the natural rights of Englishmen;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and elsewhere
the same eminent historian quaintly speaks
of a House of Burgesses as having <i>broken out</i> in
Virginia in 1619, as if there were an incurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
virus of liberty in the English blood, as if it were
something that must come out as inevitably as
original sin. But if James I. had lived longer, as I
have already observed, he would undoubtedly have
made an effort to repress this active spirit of liberty.
The colonists, on hearing of the downfall of
the Company, were in great alarm lest they should
lose their House of Burgesses, and have some
arbitrary governor appointed to rule over them,
perhaps the hated Argall himself, whom we have
seen King James selecting as one of a board of
commissioners to investigate affairs in Virginia.
In 1621, when for some reason or other the amiable
and popular Yeardley had asked to be relieved
of the duties of governor, Argall had tried to get
himself appointed in his place, but the Company
had chosen Sir Francis Wyatt, who held the office
until 1626, while Yeardley remained in Virginia
as a member of the council. In 1625, as soon as
the assembly heard of King James's death, they
sent Yeardley to England to pay their respects to
King Charles and to assure him that the people
of Virginia were thoroughly satisfied with their
government and hoped that no changes would
be made in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles I. and the tobacco trade.</div>

<p>Now it happened that Charles had a favour to
ask of the settlers in Virginia, and was in the
right sort of mood for a bargain. He was no
more in love than his father with the many-tongued
beast called Parliament, he saw how comfortably
his brother-in-law of France was getting
along without such assistance, and he was determined
if possible to do likewise. But to get along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>without parliaments a poor king must have some
means of getting money. The Virginia
tobacco crop was fast becoming a great
source of wealth; why should not the
king himself go into the tobacco trade? If all
tobacco brought to England from Virginia could
be consigned to him, then he could retail it to
consumers at his own price and realize a gigantic
profit; or, what was perhaps still better, having
obtained this monopoly, he could farm it out to
various agents who would be glad to pay roundly
for the privilege. Now the only way in which he
could treat with the people of Virginia on such
matters was through the representatives of the
people. Accordingly, when Governor Wyatt in
1626 had occasion to return to England, the king
sent back Sir George Yeardley as royal governor,
which under the circumstances was a most emphatic
assurance that the wishes of the settlers
should be granted. Furthermore, in a message to
their representatives Charles graciously addressed
them as "Our trusty and well-beloved Burgesses
of the Grand Assembly of Virginia," and thus
officially recognized that house as a coördinate
branch of the colonial government. Some arrangements
made with regard to the tobacco trade
were calculated to please the colonists. James I.,
under the influence of his mentor, Count Gondomar,
had browbeaten the Company into an arrangement
by which they consented to import
into England not more than 60,000 or less than
40,000 pounds of tobacco yearly from the Spanish
colonies. Charles I. on the other hand prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the importation of Spanish tobacco, so that Virginia
and the Bermudas had a monopoly of the
market. In spite of this friendly attitude of the
king toward the colonists, he never succeeded
in becoming the sole purchaser of their tobacco
at a stipulated price. The assembly was ready
from time to time to entertain various proposals,
but it never went so far as that; and if Charles,
in sanctioning this little New World parliament,
counted upon getting substantial aid in ignoring
his Parliament at home, he was sadly disappointed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first American legislature.</div>

<p>It is now time for us to attend a session of this
House of Burgesses, to make a report of its work,
and to mention some of the vicissitudes which it
encountered in the course of the reign of Charles
I. The place of meeting was the wooden
church at Jamestown, 50 feet in length
by 20 in width, built in 1619, for Lord
Delaware's church had become dilapidated; a solid
brick church, 56 feet by 28, was built there in
1639. From the different plantations and hundreds
the burgesses came mostly in their barges
or sloops to Jamestown. In 1634 the colony was
organized into counties and parishes, and the burgesses
thenceforth represented counties, but they
always kept their old title. At first the governor,
council, and burgesses met together in a single
assembly, just as in Massachusetts until 1644, just
as in England the Lords and Commons usually
sat together before 1339.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> A member of this Vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>ginia
parliament must take his breakfast of bacon
and hoe-cake betimes, for the meeting was called
together at the third beat of the drum, one hour
after sunrise. The sessions were always opened
with prayers, and every absence from this service
was punished with a fine of one shilling. The
fine for absence during the whole day was half a
crown. In the choir of the church sat the governor
and council, their coats trimmed with gold
lace. By the statute of 1621, passed in this very
church, no one was allowed to wear gold lace
except these high officials and the commanders of
hundreds, a class of dignitaries who in 1634 were
succeeded by the county lieutenants. In the body
of the church, facing the choir, sat the burgesses
in their best attire, with starched ruffs, and coats
of silk or velvet in bright colours. All sat with
their hats on, in imitation of the time-honoured
custom of the House of Commons, an early illustration
of the democratic doctrine, "I am as good
as you." These burgesses had their speaker, as
well as their clerk and sergeant-at-arms. Such
was the first American legislature, and two of its
acts in the year 1624 were especially memorable.
One was the declaration, passed without any dissenting
voice, "that the governor shall not lay
any taxes or impositions upon the colony, their
lands or commodities, otherway than by the
authority of the general assembly, to be levied
and employed as the said assembly shall appoint."
The other was the punishment of Edward Sharpless,
clerk of the house. When the king's commissioners
to inquire into the affairs of Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
asked for the public records of the colony the
assembly refused to show them, albeit they were
ready to answer questions propounded in a becoming
temper. But the commissioners practised
upon Sharpless and induced him to furnish them
with a copy of the records, whereupon the assembly
condemned the said Sharpless to stand in the
pillory and have half of one ear cut off.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Martin's case.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Education of Indians.</div>

<p>This general assembly was both a legislative
and a judicial body. It enacted laws and prescribed
the penalties for breaking them, it tried
before a jury persons accused of crime and saw
that due punishment was inflicted upon those who
were adjudged guilty, it determined civil causes,
assessed the amount of damages, and saw that they
were collected. From sweeping principles of constitutional
law down to the pettiest sumptuary
edicts, there was nothing which this little parliament
did not superintend and direct. On
one occasion, "the delegates from Captain
John Martin's plantation were excepted to
because of a peculiar clause in his patent releasing
him from obeying any order of the colony except
in times of war." A few days afterward the said
Captain Martin appeared at the bar of the house,
and the speaker asking whether he would relinquish
the particular clause exempting him from
colonial authority, replied that he would not yield
any part of his patent. The assembly then resolved
that the burgesses of his plantation were
not entitled to seats.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Such exemptions of individual
planters by especial license from the home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>government, although rare, were of course anomalies
not to be commended; in some cases they
proved to be nuisances, and in course of time all
were got rid of. From this constitutional question
the assembly turned to the conversion of the
red men, and enacted that each borough or hundred
should obtain from the Indians by just and
fair means a certain number of Indian children to
be educated "in true religion and a civil
course of life; of which children the
most towardly boys in wit and graces of nature
[are] to be brought up by them in the first elements
of literature, so as to be fitted for the college
intended for them, that from thence they may
be sent to that work of conversion." Few enactments
of any legislature have ever been better
intended or less fruitful than this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drunkards.</div>

<p>It was moreover enacted that any person found
drunk was for the first offence to be privately
reproved by the minister; the
second time this reproof was to be publicly administered;
the third time the offender must be put
in irons for twelve hours and pay a fine; for any
subsequent offences he must be severely punished
at the discretion of the governor and council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dress.</div>

<p>To guard the community against excessive vanity
in dress, it was enacted that for all
public contributions every unmarried
man must be assessed in church "according to his
own apparel;" and every married man must be
assessed "according to his own and his wife's apparel."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flirting.</div>

<p>Not merely extravagance in dress, but such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>social misdemeanours as flirting received due legislative
condemnation. Pretty maids were
known to encourage hopes in more than
one suitor, and gay deceivers of the sterner sex
would sometimes seek to win the affections of two
or more women at the same time. Wherefore
it was enacted that "every minister should give
notice in his church that what man or woman
soever should use any word or speech tending to
a contract of marriage to two several persons at
one time ... as might entangle or breed scruples
in their consciences, should for such their offense,
either undergo corporal correction [by whipping]
or be punished by fine or otherwise, according to
the quality of the person so offending."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Scandal.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Clergymen.</div>

<p>Men were held to more strict accountability for
the spoken or written word than in these shameless
modern days. One of the most prominent
settlers we find presenting a petition to the assembly
to grant him due satisfaction against a
neighbour who has addressed to him a letter
"wherein he taxeth him both unseemly and amiss
of certain things wherein he was never faulty."
Speaking against the governor or any
member of the council was liable to be
punished with the pillory. It was also imprudent
to speak too freely about clergymen, who were
held in great reverence. No planter could dispose
of so much as a pound of tobacco until he had laid
aside a certain specified quantity as his
assessment toward the minister's salary,
which was thus assured even in the worst times, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
far as legislation could go. It was enacted that
"noe man shall disparage a mynister whereby the
myndes of his parishoners may be alienated from
him and his mynistrie prove less effectuall, upon
payne of severe censure of the governor and councell."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
At the same time clergymen were warned
against unseemly practices in terms so concrete as
to raise a suspicion that such warning may have
been needed. "Mynisters shall not give themselves
to excesse in drinking or ryott, spending
their tyme idelie by day or by night playing at
dice, cards, or any other unlawfull game, but at
all tymes convenient they shall heare or reade
somewhat of the holy scriptures, or shall occupie
themselves with some other honest studies or exercise,
alwayes doinge the things which shall
apperteyne to honestie and endeavour to profitt
the church of God, having alwayes in mind that
they ought to excell all others in puritie of life,
should be examples to the people, to live well and
christianlie."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sabbath-breaking.</div>

<p>The well-being of Virginia society was further
protected by sundry statutes such as the one which
punished profane swearing by a fine of one shilling
per oath. "For the better observation
of the Saboth" it was enacted that
no person "shall take a voyage vppon the same,
except it be to church or for other causes of
extreme necessitie," under penalty of forfeiting
twenty pounds of tobacco for each offence. A
similar fine was imposed for firing a gun upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Sunday, unless it might be for defence against the
Indians. Selling arms or ammunition to Indians
was punished by imprisonment for life, with confiscation
of goods. Every master of a family was
required, under penalty of ten pounds of tobacco,
to bring with him to church every Sunday a serviceable
gun with plenty of powder and shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strong drink.</div>

<p>Stringent legislation protected the rights of
thirsty persons. "Whereas there hath
been great abuse by the vnreasonable
rates enacted by ordinary keepers, and retaylers
of wine and strong waters," maximum prices were
established as follows: for Spanish wines 30 lbs.
of tobacco per gallon, for Madeira 20 lbs., for
French wines 15 lbs., for brandy 40 lbs., for "the
best sorte of all English strong waters" 80 lbs.;
and any vender charging above these rates was to
be fined at double the rate. For corrupting or
"sophisticating" good liquor by fraudulent admixtures,
a fine was imposed at the discretion of the
commissioners of the county courts. The inn-keeper
who sold wines and spirits to his guests did
so at his own risk, for such debts were not recoverable
at law.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Forestallers.</div>

<p>The ancient prejudice against forestalling survives
in the following statute, which would make
havoc of the business of some modern brokers:
"Whatsoever person or persons shall buy

<div class="sidenote">The kingdom of Virginia.</div>

<p>Edmund Spenser, in his dedication of the
"Faëry Queene," in 1590, calls Elizabeth the
queen of England, France, and Ireland, and of
Virginia, thus characterizing as a kingdom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
vast and vague domain in the New World which
she was appropriating. Soon after the downfall
of the Virginia Company, the document containing
Charles I.'s appointment of William Claiborne
as secretary of state in the colony mentioned
it as "our kingdom of Virginia;"
and the phrase occurs in other writings
of the time. It is a phrase that seems especially
appropriate for the colony after it had come to
be a royal province, directly dependent upon the
king for its administration. During the reign of
Charles I. the relations of the kingdom of Virginia
to the mother country were marked by few
memorable incidents. In this respect the contrast
with the preceding reign is quite striking. One
must read the story in the original state papers,
correspondence, and pamphlets of the time, in
order to realize to what an extent the colony was
cut loose by the overthrow of the Company. The
most interesting and important questions that came
up were connected with the settlement of Maryland,
but before we enter upon that subject, a few
words are needed on the succession of royal governors
in Virginia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A convivial governor.</div>

<p>The commission of Yeardley in 1626 named Sir
John Harvey as his successor. When Yeardley
died in 1627, Harvey had not arrived upon the
scene, and needed to be notified. In such cases it
was the business of the council to appoint a governor
<i>ad interim</i>, and the council appointed one of
the oldest and most honoured settlers, Francis
West, brother of the late Lord Delaware. After
one year of service business called West to Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>land,
and his place was taken by Dr. John Pott,
who held the government until Sir John Harvey's
arrival in March, 1630. This Dr. Pott is described
as "a Master of Arts, ... well practised in chirurgery
and physic, and expert also in distilling of
waters, [besides] many other ingenious devices."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
It seems that he was likewise very fond
of tasting distilled waters, and at times
was more of a boon companion than quite comported
with his dignity, especially after he had
come to be governor. A letter of George Sandys
to a friend in London says of Dr. Pott, "at first
he kept company too much with his inferiors, who
hung upon him while his good liquor lasted.
After, he consorted with Captain Whitacres, a
man of no good example, with whom he has gone
to Kecoughtan."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> What was done by the twain
at Kecoughtan is not matter of record, but we are
left with a suggestion of the darkest possibilities
of a carouse.</p>

<p>After Harvey's arrival ex-Governor Pott was
arrested, and held to answer two charges: one was
for having abused the powers entrusted to him by
pardoning a culprit who had been convicted of
wilful murder; the other was for stealing cattle.
The first charge was a matter of common notoriety;
on the second Dr. Pott was tried by a jury
and found guilty. The ex-governor was not only
a pardoner of felony, but a felon himself. The
affair reads like a scene in comic opera. Some
reluctance was felt about inflicting vulgar punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>ment
upon an educated man of good social position;
so he was not sent to jail but confined in his
own house, while Sir John Harvey wrote to the
king for instructions in the matter. He informed
the king that Dr. Pott was by far the best physician
in the colony, and indeed the only one
"skilled in epidemicals," and recommended that
he should be pardoned. Accordingly the doctor
was set free and forthwith resumed his practice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of Virginia.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Other colonies.</div>

<p>Soon it was Governor Harvey's turn to get into
difficulties. How he was "thrust out" from his
government in 1635 and restored to it by Charles
I. in 1637 will best be told in a future chapter in
connection with the affairs of Maryland. After
Harvey's final departure in 1639, Sir Francis
Wyatt was once more governor for three years,
and then came the famous Sir William Berkeley,
who remained for five-and-thirty years
the most conspicuous figure in Virginia.
When Berkeley arrived upon the scene, in 1642,
on the eve of the great Civil War, he received
from Wyatt the government of a much greater
Virginia than that over which Wyatt was ruling
in 1624. Those eighteen years of self-government
had been years of remarkable prosperity and progress.
Instead of 4,000 English and 22 negroes,
the population now numbered 15,000 English and
300 negroes. Moreover, Virginia was no longer
the only English colony. In 1624 there were no
others, except the little band of about
200 Pilgrims at Plymouth. In 1642 the
population of New England numbered 26,000,
distributed among half-a-dozen self-governing col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>onies.
There was also a community of Dutchmen
laying claim to the whole region between
the Mohawk valley and Delaware Bay, with a
flourishing town on Manhattan Island in the finest
commercial situation on the whole Atlantic coast.
The Virginians did not relish the presence of
these Dutchmen, for they too laid claim to that
noble tract of country. The people of Virginia
had made the first self-supporting colony and felt
that they had established a claim upon the middle
zone. The very name Virginia had not yet ceased
to cling to it. In books of that time one may read
of the town of New Amsterdam upon the island of
Manhattan in Virginia. In 1635 a party of Virginians
went up to the Delaware River and took
possession of an old blockhouse there, called Fort
Nassau, which the Dutch had abandoned; but a
force from New Amsterdam speedily took them
prisoners and sent them back to Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> with a
polite warning not to do so any more. They did
not.</p>

<p>Still nearer at hand, by the waters of the Potomac
and Susquehanna, other rivals and competitors,
even more unwelcome to the Virginians, had
lately come upon the scene. The circumstances of
the founding of Maryland, with its effects upon
the kingdom of Virginia, will be recounted in the
two following chapters.</p>

<p class="c">THE MARYLAND PALATINATE.</p>


<div class="sidenote">The Irish Baltimore.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the southwestern coast of Ireland, not far
from Cape Clear, the steamship on its way from
New York to Liverpool passes within
sight of a small promontory crowned by
an ancient village bearing the Gaelic name of
Baltimore, which signifies "large townlands."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
The events which transferred this Irish name to
the banks of the Patapsco River make an interesting
chapter of history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">George Calvert.</div>

<p>George Calvert, son of a wealthy Yorkshire
farmer of Flemish descent, was born about 1580.
After taking his degree at Oxford and travelling
for some time on the Continent, he was
employed as an under-secretary in the
state department by Sir Robert Cecil, after whom
he named his eldest son Cecilius. His warm advocacy
of the Spanish marriage made him a great
favourite of James I., so that in 1617 he was
knighted and in 1619 was appointed secretary of
state. He seems always to have had a leaning
toward the Roman Church. Whether he was converted
in 1624, or simply made public profession
of a faith long cherished in secret, is matter of
doubt. At all events, he resigned his secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>ship
at that time. The next year one of the last
things done by James, a few days before his death,
was to raise Calvert to the Irish peerage as Baron
Baltimore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A palatinate in Newfoundland.</div>

<p>The son of Mary Stuart had a liberal way of
dealing with his favourites. In March, 1623, he
granted the great southeastern promontory
in Newfoundland&mdash;the region now
known as Ferryland, between Trinity
and Placentia bays&mdash;to George Calvert, to be
held by him and his heirs forever. The government
was to be a "palatinate," a statement which
calls for a somewhat detailed explanation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of palatinates.</div>

<p>When that great and far-sighted ruler William
the Conqueror arranged the affairs of England
after the battle of Hastings, he sought to prevent
such evils as those against which the newly
founded Capetian monarchy in France was struggling
for life, evils arising from the imperfect
subordination of the great feudal lords. To this
end he made it a rule not to grant large contiguous
estates to the same lord, and in every county
he provided that the king's officer, the sheriff,
should be clothed with powers overriding those of
the local manorial officers. He also obliged the
tenants of the barons to swear fealty directly to
the crown. This shrewd and wholesome policy, as
developed under his able son Henry I. and his
still abler great-grandson Henry II., has profoundly
affected the political career of the English
race. But to this general policy William
admitted one class of exceptions. In
the border counties, which were never quite free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
from the fear of invasion, and where lawlessness
was apt to be more or less prevalent in time of
peace, it was desirable to make the local rulers
more powerful. Considerations of this sort prevailed
throughout mediæval Europe. Universally,
the ruler of a march or border county, the count
or graf or earl placed in such a responsible position,
acquired additional power and dignity, and
came to be distinguished by a grander title, as
margrave, marquis, or count of the marches. In
accordance with this general principle, William
the Conqueror granted exceptional powers and
consolidation of authority to three counties, to
Durham on the Scotch border, to Chester on the
border of Wales, and to Kent, where an invader
from the Continent might with least difficulty
effect a landing. Local administration in those
counties was concentrated in the hands of
the county ruler; they were made exceptionally
strong to serve as buffers for the rest of the
kingdom, and they were called "palatinates" or
"counties palatine," implying that within their
boundaries the rulers had quasi-regal rights as
complete as those which the king had in his palace.
They appointed the officers of justice, they could
pardon treasons and felonies, forfeitures at common
law accrued to them, and legal writs ran in
their name instead of the king's. The title of
"count palatine" carries us back to the times of
the Merovingian kings in Gaul, when it belonged
to one of the highest officers in the royal household,
who took judicial cognizance of all pleas
of the crown. Hence the title came to be applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
to other officers endowed with quasi-regal powers.
Such were the counts palatine of the Rhine and
Bavaria, who in the course of the thirteenth century
became electoral princes of the Holy Roman
Empire. One of their domains, the Rhenish Palatinate,
of which Heidelberg in its peerless beauty
is the crown and glory, has contributed, as we
shall hereafter see, an element of no small importance
to the population of the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in English palatinates.</div>

<p>To return to William the Conqueror: in an age
when the organization of society was so imperfect,
and action at a distance so slow and difficult, the
possession of quasi-regal powers by the
rulers of the palatine counties made it
much easier for them to summon quickly
their feudal forces in case of sudden invasion. In
view of the frequency of quarrels and raids on the
border, the quasi-regal authority was liable at any
moment to be needed to prevent war from breaking
out, and the proper administration of justice
demanded a short shrift and a sharp doom for evil-doers.
The powers granted by William to the
palatine counties resembled those wielded by the
French dukedoms of the same period, but with
admirable forethought he appointed to rule them
priests who could not marry and found feudal
families. Durham and for a time Chester were
ruled by their bishops, and over Kent as a secular
jurisdiction William placed his own brother, Odo,
Bishop of Bayeux. In course of time many
changes occurred. Kent soon lost its palatine
privileges, while those of Chester were exercised
by its earls until the reign of Henry III., when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
earldom lapsed to the crown. After the conquest
of Wales the county of Pembroke on its southwestern
coast was made a palatinate, but its privileges
were withdrawn by Henry VIII. For a
time such privileges were enjoyed by Hexhamshire,
between Durham and Northumberland, but under
Elizabeth that little county was absorbed in
Northumberland. One other northern shire, the
duchy of Lancaster, was made a palatinate by
Edward III., but that came to an end in 1399,
when the Duke of Lancaster ascended the throne
of England as Henry IV. Traces of its old palatinate
jurisdiction, however, still survive. Until
the Judicature Act of 1873 Lancaster and Durham
had each its own distinct and independent
court of common pleas, and the duchy of Lancaster
has still its own chancellor and chancery court
outside of the jurisdiction of the lord chancellor.
As for the palatine authority of the bishops of
Durham, it was vested in the crown in the year
preceding the accession of Victoria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishopric of Durham.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Avalon and Durham.</div>

<p>From this survey it appears that by the end of
the sixteenth century the bishopric of Durham was
left as the only complete instance of a palatinate,
or kingdom within the kingdom. In the
northern marches the need for such a
buffer was longer felt than elsewhere,
and the old political structure remained very much
as it had been created by William I., with the
mitred bishop at its head. The great Norman
cathedral, in its position of unequalled grandeur,</p>

<p>still rears its towers in the blue sky to remind us
of the stern days when tartan-clad thousands came
swarming across the Tweed, to fall in heaps before
the longbow at Halidon Hill and Neville's Cross
and on many another field of blood. When the
king of Scots came to be king of England, this
principality of Durham afforded an instance of a
dominion thoroughly English yet semi-independent,
unimpeachable for loyalty but distinct in its
administration. It was not strange, therefore, that
it should have served as a pattern for colonial
governments to be set up in the New World. For
such governments virtual independence combined
with hearty allegiance was the chief desideratum,
a fact which in later days George III. unfortunately
forgot. From the merely military point of
view a colony in the American wilderness stood in
at least as much need of palatine authority as any
frontier district in the Old World. Accordingly,
when it was decided to entrust the work of founding
an American colony to a nobleman with his
clientage of followers, an example of the needful
organization was already furnished by the great
northern bishopric. Calvert's province in Newfoundland,
which received the name of Avalon,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> was to be modelled after the
palatinate of Durham, and the powers granted to
its lord proprietor were perhaps the most extensive
ever bestowed by the English crown upon any
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Baltimore's colony in Newfoundland.</div>

<p>A party of colonists went at once to Newfoundland
in 1623, but various affairs detained
Lord Baltimore at home until 1627, when
he came with his wife and children to
dwell in this New World paradise of Avalon. The
trail of the serpent was already there. A French
fleet came to attack the colony, meditating revenge
for Argall's treatment of the French at Mount
Desert and Port Royal, but Baltimore's ships were
heavily armed and well handled, and the Frenchmen
got the worst of it. Then a party of Puritans
came to Avalon, and these unbidden guests were
horrified at what they saw. The Rev. Erasmus
Stourton returned to England with a shocking
story of how Lord Baltimore not only had the
mass performed every Sunday, but had even allowed
a Presbyterian child to be baptized by a
Romish priest. Then the climate of Avalon proved
to be anything but what had been expected. One
Captain Richard Whitbourne had published an
enthusiastic book in which he recorded his memories
of June days in Newfoundland, with their
delicious wild strawberries and cherries, the soft
air redolent with the fragrance of red and white
roses, the woods vocal with thrushes and other
songsters that rivalled the nightingale; of wild
beasts there were none that were harmful, and "in
St. John's harbour he once saw a mermaid."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
Lord Baltimore learned that it was not always
June in Avalon. He wrote to Charles I. in August,
1629, as follows: "I have met with difficulties
and encumbrances here which in this place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
are no longer to be resisted, but enforce me presently
to quit my residence and to shift to some
other warmer climate of this New World, where
the winters be shorter and less rigorous. For here
your Majesty may please to understand that I have
found by too dear-bought experience, which other
men for their private interests always concealed
from me, that from the middle of October to the
middle of May there is a sad fare of winter upon
all this land; both sea and land so frozen for the
greater part of the time as they are not penetrable,
no plant or vegetable thing appearing out of the
earth until the beginning of May, nor fish in the
sea; beside the air so intolerable cold as it is
hardly to be endured. By means whereof, and of
much salt meat, my house hath been an hospital
all this winter; of a hundred persons fifty sick at
a time, myself being one, and nine or ten of them
died. Hereupon I have had strong temptations to
leave all proceedings in plantations, and being
much decayed in my strength, to retire myself to
my former quiet; but my inclination carrying me
naturally to these kind of works, and not knowing
how better to employ the poor remainder of my
days than ... to further, the best I may, the
enlarging your Majesty's empire in this part of
the world, I am determined to commit this place
to fishermen that are able to encounter storms and
hard weather, and to remove myself with some
forty persons to your Majesty's dominion Virginia;
where, if your Majesty will please to grant me a
precinct of land, with such privileges as the king
your father ... was pleased to grant me here, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Baltimore's visit to Virginia.</div>

<p>To this letter the king returned a gracious reply,
in which he advised Lord Baltimore, for the
sake of his own comfort and peace of mind, to give
up such arduous kind of work and return to England;
but before this reply reached Avalon, its
proprietor had sailed for Virginia, with
Lady Baltimore and the children, and a
small retinue of servants and followers.
He wished to see that country with his own eyes
and learn if it were really fit for his purposes. On
the first day of October, 1629, he arrived at Jamestown,
where he found the assembly in session.
That versatile physician, Dr. Pott, so skilled in
"epidemicals" and strong waters and afterward
convicted of lifting cattle, was then acting as governor.
The reception given to Lord Baltimore
was anything but cordial. All good Virginians
hated Papists, and this particular Papist was
known to stand in high favour with the king, so
that he might turn out to be dangerous. He had
been one of the commissioners appointed by James
I. to look into the affairs of Virginia; what if he
were to persuade Charles I. to turn over the colony
into his hands for safe-keeping? There was
really not the slightest danger of such a thing.
Baltimore's wish was not to take possession of a
colony already established, but to found one himself
in accordance with his own ideas. It was not
his purpose to become lord over the Virginians, but
their neighbour, who might dwell near them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
amicable terms. But the Virginians did not wish
to receive him in any capacity or on any terms,
except as a transient guest. There was an obvious
and easy device for getting rid of him. Dr.
Pott and the council tendered to him the oath of
supremacy, which of course he could not take.
This oath was a sworn recognition of the English
sovereign as the only supreme authority throughout
the British dominions in all matters ecclesiastical
and spiritual. No Catholic could take such
an oath. Baltimore proposed an alternative declaration
of allegiance to which he could swear, but
such a compromise was of course refused. Even
had Dr. Pott and the council felt authorized to
assume such responsibility, accommodation was not
what they desired, and the royal favourite was told
that he must sail for England at once. It appears
that he met with some very rude treatment at
Jamestown, which does not seem to have been publicly
rebuked until the arrival of the new royal
governor, Sir John Harvey, in the following
March; for on the records of the assembly for
March 25, 1630, occurs the entry: "Thomas Tindall
to be pilloried two hours, for giving my Lord
Baltimore the lie and threatening to knock him
down." It is evident, however, that such unseemly
conduct could not have met with approval among
respectable people at Jamestown, for when Baltimore
sailed he left his wife and children there.
It is clear that he intended soon to return, and
wished to save them the discomforts and perils of
the double voyage. He knew that Virginian hospitality
could be relied on. His purpose of return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ing
must have been well known, for the secretary
of the colony, William Claiborne, was sent to London
to keep an eye upon him and thwart his
schemes as far as possible. After arriving in England,
Lord Baltimore found so many hindrances to
be reckoned with that he sent for his family and
they followed him by a later ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The charter of Maryland.</div>

<p>Baltimore's first request was for a tract of territory
lying south of James River as far as the
mouth of the Chowan (or Passamagnus) River
in Albemarle Sound. This province was to be
called Carolina, either in honour of Charles I., or
because the name had been given by the Huguenots
in 1562 in honour of Charles IX. of France
to a point farther south on that coast and was
vaguely applicable to territory between Virginia
and Florida. A charter conveying this land to
Lord Baltimore had already been made out when
Claiborne appeared with his objections, which were
supported by other persons in London who were
entertaining schemes for founding a sugar-planting
colony in Carolina. The matter was discussed
in the Privy Council, and Baltimore's attention
was called to the fact that the Dutch were taking
possession of the country between the Hudson
and Delaware rivers; would it not therefore be
desirable to found a colony north of the Potomac,
and squeeze these unwelcome intruders into as
narrow a space as possible? Baltimore accepted
this suggestion, and a charter was drawn
up, granting to him as lord proprietor
the province which received the name of Maryland,
after Charles's Catholic queen, Henriette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Marie, in England commonly called Queen Mary.
The charter, which Baltimore drew up with his
own hand, was in the main a copy of the Avalon
charter; but before it had received the royal seal
he died, in April, 1632. In June the charter was
issued to his eldest son Cecilius Calvert, second
baron of Baltimore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fate of the Avalon charter.</div>

<p>In obtaining this new grant of Maryland, the
Calverts did not regard themselves as giving up
their hold upon Newfoundland. Cecilius appointed
a governor for Avalon as a fishing station, but in
1637, with characteristic recklessness, the king
granted it to the Marquis of Hamilton and some
other noblemen, on the ground that the
charter had been forfeited by disuse.
More or less controversy went on until
1663, when in consequence of a judgment in the
courts pronouncing the Hamilton grant void,
Avalon was surrendered to Cecilius. But his descendants
really neglected it, until in 1754 the
charter was again declared forfeited, and the
crown resumed its rights over the whole of that
large island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of the first Lord Baltimore.</div>

<p>It seems to have been the physical hardships
sustained in Newfoundland that cut off the first
Lord Baltimore prematurely in his fifty-third
year and prevented his witnessing the success of
the enterprise which he had so much at heart.
His plan was to found in the New World a commonwealth
where Catholics might find a welcome
refuge from the oppressive legislation to which
they were subjected in England. It was a plan
that could be carried out only by adopting a policy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>of universal toleration utterly unknown in that
age outside of the Netherlands. It called
for the utmost sagacity and tact, and
was likely to require on the part of the
ruler all the well-nigh royal powers with which
Lord Baltimore had been endowed. Though the
scheme was left for the son to put into successful
operation, it was devised by the father and stamps
him as no ordinary man. It is right that he
should be honoured as the first founder of Maryland.
His portrait, painted for Lord Bacon by
the illustrious Daniel Mytens, is now in the gallery
of the Earl of Verulam, and there is a fine copy
of it in the state-house at Annapolis. The face
is courteous and amiable, albeit somewhat melancholy,
and shows refinement and intelligence, as
well as the honesty for which he was noted.
George Calvert's integrity was such that throughout
his public life men respected and trusted him
without distinction of party. Of the sincerity of
his religious feelings one gets a glimpse in such
characteristic passages as the following, from a
letter to his friend, the great Earl of Strafford:
"All things, my lord, in this world pass away;
wife, children, honours, wealth, friends, and what
else is dear to flesh and blood. They are but lent
us till God please to call for them back again,
that we may not esteem anything our own, or set
our hearts upon anything but Him alone, who
only remains forever."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cecilius Calvert, second Lord Baltimore.</div>

<p>Of the early life of the son, Cecilius Calvert,
very little is known. He was born in 1606 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1621, but
there is no record of his having taken a degree.
He was hardly more than eighteen years old when
he became the husband of Lady Anne
Arundel, whose name is left upon one
of the counties of Maryland, and whose
portrait by Vandyck, preserved in Wardour Castle,
shows her to have been one of the most beautiful
women of her time. An engraved portrait of
Cecilius, made in 1657 and now in possession of
the Maryland Historical Society, gives us the impression
of great sagacity and power, with the
repose that comes from undisturbed self-control.
There is perhaps more astuteness than in the
father's face, but the look is also frank, as well as
lofty and refined. Through many difficulties the
plan conceived by George Calvert was put into
operation by Cecilius, who is to be regarded as
preëminently the founder of Maryland. His strong
personality is impressed upon the whole history of
that interesting community; yet singularly enough,
the second Lord Baltimore never visited the colony
to which the labours of his long life were
devoted. He cherished at first an intention of
going out with the first party of colonists, but
finding that London fairly swarmed with enemies
to the enterprise, he found it most prudent to stay
there and contend with them. This was only the
beginning of long years of arduous work in which
the right time for leaving England never came,
and the Moses of this new migration and fresh
departure in the way of founding states was at
last gathered unto his fathers without ever having
set foot in the Promised Land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A new type of colonial government.</div>

<p>In two ways the founding of Maryland was a
new departure in methods of colonization. In the
first place, it introduced into America a new type
of colonial government. The Spanish and French
colonies were simple despotisms administered by
viceroyal governors, sometimes with advisory councils,
sometimes partly held in check by an officer
called the intendant, who was himself a
counter-despot. The government of Virginia
after the suppression of the Company
was called a crown government because the
governor and council were appointed by the king;
it was not a despotism, because there was an assembly
elected by the people, without whose consent
no taxes could be assessed or collected. The bond
of connection with the mother country was loose
but real. A contrast was afforded by Massachusetts,
which under its first charter, from 1629 to
1684, was a true republic, with governor, council,
and assembly all elected within the colony, so that
the administration could move on quite independently
of any action in England. In the proprietary
governments, of which Maryland was the
first example, the lord proprietor stepped into the
place of the crown, while a charter, which might
be forfeited in case of abuse, made it impossible
for him to become an absolute monarch. The
elective legislature of Maryland, which in point
of seniority ranks third in America, next after
Virginia and Massachusetts, was expressly provided
for in the charter. The lord proprietor's
sovereignty was limited by this elected assembly
of freemen, but his dependence upon the king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
England was little more than nominal. In token
of allegiance and homage he was to send to the
king each year two Indian arrows. His rent was
to be one fifth part of all gold or silver mined in
Maryland, but as no precious metals were found
there, this rent amounted to nothing. Moreover,
whenever it might seem necessary, the oath of
allegiance might be administered to any of the inhabitants.
Saving this formal recognition of his
overlord, the lord proprietor was virtually king
in Maryland. Laws passed by the assembly became
valid as soon as he had signed them, and did
not need to be seen by the king. In case the
assembly could not conveniently be brought together
in an emergency, he could issue ordinances
by himself, analogous to the orders of the Privy
Council. He could coin money and grant titles of
nobility, he could create courts, appoint judges,
and pardon criminals. It was moreover expressly
stipulated that within the limits of Maryland no
taxes could be either assessed or collected by any
British government. Finally the lord proprietorship
was vested in Cecilius Calvert and his heirs,
and in point of fact was exercised by them with
some interruptions for five generations; so that
the government of colonial Maryland was really
a hereditary constitutional monarchy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical powers of the lord proprietor.</div>

<p>Thus Lord Baltimore introduced into America
a new and quite remarkable type of colonial government.
But in the second place his attempt
to inaugurate a policy of complete
religious toleration was a still more memorable
departure from familiar methods. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the express provisions of the charter there was
nothing that looked toward such complete toleration.
Any express toleration of Catholics would
have ruined the whole scheme at the start. The
words of the charter were conveniently vague. In
the original charter of Avalon the lord proprietor
was entrusted with "the patronage and advowsons
of all churches which, with the increasing
worship and religion of Christ within the said
region, hereafter shall happen to be built; together
with license and faculty of erecting and founding
churches, chapels, and places of worship, in convenient
and suitable places, within the premises,
and of causing the same to be dedicated and consecrated
according to the ecclesiastical laws of
England." This Avalon grant of 1623 was made
when Sir George Calvert was still a member of
the English church; it empowered him to found
Anglican churches, but did not expressly prohibit
him from founding Romanist or Nonconformist
places of worship along with the others if he
should see fit. Now exactly the same words were
repeated in the Maryland charter, although it was
generally known that Lord Baltimore intended to
make that colony an asylum for such English
Catholics as wished to escape from their grievances
at home. The fact that no prohibition was
inserted shows that the king connived at Baltimore's
scheme, perhaps through sympathy with
his Catholic queen. None of the Stuarts were
fierce Protestants, and it is worth noting that it
was at the king's request that the colony was
named Maryland. Mr. Gardiner's opinion seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
well sustained, that "the phrases of the charter
were intended to cover a secret understanding between
Baltimore and the king."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious toleration in Maryland.</div>

<p>Starting with such a charter, religious toleration
in Maryland was a happy product of circumstances.
In view of the regal powers wielded by
Lord Baltimore it was not easy for the Protestant
settlers to oppress the Catholics; while,
on the other hand, if the Catholic settlers
had been allowed to annoy the
Protestants, it would forthwith have raised such a
storm in England as would have overwhelmed the
lord proprietor and blasted his enterprise. The
situation thus created was improved to the best
advantage by the strong common-sense and unfailing
tact of Cecilius Calvert. It is not likely that
he had arrived at such advanced views of the
entire separation of church and state as those
which were set forth with such luminous cogency
by Roger Williams, but there was a statesmanlike
instinct in him that led him in a similar direction.
In point of religious toleration Rhode Island unquestionably
holds the foremost place among the
colonies, while next after it come Quaker Pennsylvania,
with New Netherland, which for its brief
season maintained the wholesome Dutch traditions.
There are some respects in which Maryland's
record may vie with the brightest, but her
success was not attained without struggles. We
shall presently have occasion to see how curiously
her beginnings were complicated with the affairs
of her elder sister Virginia and with some phases
of the Puritan revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">First settlement at St. Mary's.</div>

<p>If Lord Baltimore felt obliged himself to stay
in England, he was able to send excellent
agents to America in the persons of his
younger brothers, Leonard and George
Calvert. The former he appointed governor of
Maryland. The most important member of the
council was Thomas Cornwallis, of an ancient and
highly honourable London family, the same to
which in later days belonged the Earl Cornwallis
who surrendered an army to George Washington
at Yorktown.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Leonard Calvert's ships were the
Ark, of 300 tons burthen, with its attendant pinnace,
the Dove, of 50 tons; and his company comprised
20 "gentlemen adventurers" with about
300 labourers. So alarmed were London people
at the expedition that it took the ships a full
month to get away from the Thames River. All
kinds of rumours flew about. It was assumed
that all Catholics must be in league with Spain
and that these ships must be concerned in some
foul conspiracy against the English colonies in
America. At the last moment a great fuss was
made in the Star Chamber, and Coke sent an
order post-haste to Admiral Pennington commanding
the channel fleet to stop the ships at Dover.
The oath of supremacy was administered, and we
hear of 128 persons taking it at one time. It
is generally believed that the majority of the company
were Protestants; the leaders were nearly
all Catholics, including the amiable Jesuit, Father
Andrew White, who has left us in quaint
and very charming Latin a full narrative of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
voyage.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The ships finally started on the 22d
of November, 1633, stopped for a while in January
at Barbadoes, and on the 27th of February
reached Point Comfort, where a letter from the
king ensured them courteous treatment at the
hands of Governor Harvey. With a fresh stock
of supplies they sailed up Chesapeake Bay and
into the broad Potomac, and presently on a little
wooded island which they called St. Clement's&mdash;since
dwindled to the mere vestige of a sand-bank&mdash;they
celebrated Mass for the first time in English
America on the 25th of March, 1634.</p>

<p class="caption center">THE PALATINATE OF MARYLAND
</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Relations with the Indians.</div>

<p>On a bluff overlooking the deep and broad St.
Mary's River the settlers found an Indian
village, which they bought from its
occupants with steel hatchets and hoes
and pieces of cloth. These Indians were a tribe of
Algonquins, who had been so persecuted by their
terrible Iroquois neighbours, the Susquehannocks,
that they were already intending to move away to
some safer region; so they welcomed the white
purchasers and the chance for buying steel hatchets.
Leonard Calvert was as scrupulously just in his
dealings with red men as William Penn in later
days, and like Penn he was exceptionally favoured
by the circumstances of his Indian neighbours.
After the Algonquins had departed from St.
Mary's, the fierce Susquehannocks to the northward
were so hard pressed by their hostile kinsmen
of the Five Nations, that they were only too
glad to live on amicable terms with the settlers
of Maryland. Thus one of the most formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
difficulties in the way of American colonization
was removed at the start.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prosperity of the settlement.</div>

<p>At St. Mary's, moreover, there was no Starving
Time. The land had so long been cleared
by the Indians for their own cornfields
that Calvert's settlers at once began
planting for themselves. Father White speaks
with approval of two native dishes which the Indians
call "pone" and "hominy," and from their
squaws the English women soon learned how to
bake and fry these viands to perfection. In the
course of the very first autumn the Marylanders
were able to export a shipload of corn to New
England in exchange for a cargo of salted codfish.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Cattle and swine were obtained from Virginia,
and soon the neighbourhood of St. Mary's
was covered with thrifty and smiling farms. New
colonists came quite steadily, and presently from
St. Mary's the plantations spread about the shores
of the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. The
first assembly was convened and the first laws
were enacted in 1635, and when Cecilius, Lord
Baltimore, died, just forty years afterward, his
Maryland had grown to be a prosperous community
of 20,000 souls.</p>

<p>Some of the more important details of this
growth will form part of our story. At present
we have to consider somewhat more closely the
nature of this palatinate government, and the modifications
which it underwent in its transfer from
England to America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constitution of Durham: the receiver-general.</div>

<p>The Bishop of Durham was feudal landlord of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>the territory in his bishopric, and the most considerable
part of his revenue came from rents.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Until 1660 he also received a fluctuating but not
insignificant income from such feudal incidents as
escheats, forfeitures, and wardships. The rents
and feudal dues were collected by the bailiffs, each
in his bailiwick, and were by them paid
over to the receiver-general, who was
superintendent of the palatinate's
finances. As for Durham's share of the national
taxes, Parliament simply determined the amount;
the bishop's government decided how it should be
raised and his constables collected it. The only
taxes collected by the king's officers were the customs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord lieutenant and high sheriff.</div>

<p>After 1536 the militia force of Durham, like
that of other counties, was commanded by an
officer known as lord lieutenant. Formerly
the command of the militia and
collecting and disbursing of revenue
were concentrated in the hands of the high sheriff,
who continued to be nominally the superior officer
over the lord lieutenant and receiver-general, while
his actual duties were restricted, like those of sheriffs
in other counties, to enforcing the decisions of
the courts. But whereas all other sheriffs were
crown officers, the high sheriff of Durham was
accountable only to the bishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Chancellor of temporalities.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The halmote.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The seneschal.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop's council.</div>

<p>The only officer of higher dignity than the high
sheriff was the chancellor of temporalities, who
exercised a twofold function. He was
the bishop's chief minister and head of
the civil government, and he presided
over the bishop's high court of chancery. Below
this high tribunal there were two kinds of courts.
The one was like the ordinary courts of quarter
sessions, composed of justices of the peace, save
that these justices were appointed by the bishop
and punished breaches not of the king's peace but
of the bishop's peace. The other kind of court
was one that could be held in any manor
of the bishopric. It was the manorial
court or "halmote," the most interesting of these
ancient institutions of Durham. The business of
the halmote courts was to adjust all questions
relating to the tenure of land, rights or easements
in land, and such other matters as intimately concerned
the little agricultural community of tenants
of the manor. They could also issue injunctions
and inflict sundry penalties. These courts were
held by the seneschal, an officer charged
with the general supervision of manors,
but all the tenants of the manor in question
could attend the halmote, and could speak and
vote there, so that it was like a town-meeting.
When we add that it could enact by-laws, thus
combining legislative with judicial functions, we
see its ancestry disclosed. This halmote in Durham
was a descendant of the ancient folkmote or
primary assembly which our forefathers brought
into Britain from their earlier home in the wilds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>of northern Germany. In this assembly the people
of Durham preserved their self-government in
matters of local concern. But the circumstances
in which the palatinate grew up seem to have
retarded the development of representative government.
There was no shire-mote in Durham,
attended by selected men from every manor or
parish or township, as in the other counties of
England. Instead of laws enacted by such a representative
body, there were ordinances
passed by the bishop in his council,
which was composed of the principal magistrates
already mentioned, and of such noblemen or other
prominent persons as might choose to come or
such as might be invited by the bishop. It thus
resembled in miniature a witenagemote or house
of lords. The bishops of Durham seem to have
been in general responsive to public opinion in
their little world, and it does not appear that the
people fared worse than they would have done
with a representative assembly. The bishop was
not an autocrat, but a member of a great ecclesiastical
body, and if he made himself unpopular
it was quite possible to take steps that would lead
to his removal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">National representation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Limitations upon autonomy.</div>

<p>The lack of representative institutions in Durham,
coupled with its semi-independence, long
retarded its participation in the work
of national legislation. The bishop, of
course, sat in the House of Lords, but
not until the reign of Charles II. was this county
palatine represented in the House of Commons.
The change was inaugurated by Cromwell, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>whose protectorship the palatine privileges were
taken away, and Durham, reduced to the likeness
of other counties, elected its members of Parliament.
In 1660 the restored monarchy undid this
change and replaced the bishop, although with
his palatinate privileges slightly shorn. In 1675
Durham began to be regularly represented in the
House of Commons, but that date was subsequent
to the founding of the Maryland palatinate. At
the time when Lord Baltimore's charter was
issued, the bonds of connection between Durham
and the rest of England were three: 1. the bishop
was a tenant <i>in capite</i> of the crown, besides
being an officer of the Church and
a member of the House of Lords; 2. the
county regularly paid its share of the national
taxes; and 3. cases in litigation between the
bishop and his subjects could be appealed to the
Court of Exchequer in London. Saving these
important limitations, Durham was independent.
The only way in which the king could act within
its limits was by addressing the bishop, who by
way of climax to his many attributes of sovereignty
was endowed with the powers of coining
money, chartering towns, and exercising admiralty
jurisdiction over his seacoast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The palatinate type in America.</div>

<p>As I have already observed it was natural that
in founding new governments in America, this
familiar example of the Durham palatinate
should be made to serve as a model.
In point of fact not only Maryland, but
every colony afterwards founded, except in New
England, was at first a palatinate, with either a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
single lord proprietor or a board of proprietors at
its head. Of the four colonies older than Maryland,
three&mdash;English Virginia and Massachusetts,
and Dutch New Netherland&mdash;were founded
through the instrumentality of charters granted to
joint-stock companies, organized really or ostensibly
for commercial purposes; one, Plymouth, was
founded by the people and ignored by the crown
until finally suppressed by it. Of the four New
England colonies younger than Maryland, all were
founded by the people themselves, one of them,
New Haven, was soon suppressed, another, New
Hampshire, was turned into a royal province, the
other two, Connecticut and Rhode Island, were
for the most part let alone. The governments of
all the other colonies began as proprietary governments.
This was the case with New York and the
two Jerseys after the English conquest of New
Netherland; it was the case with Pennsylvania
and Delaware, with the two Carolinas, and with
Georgia. One and all of these were variations
upon the theme first adopted in the founding of
Maryland. All were based upon the palatinate
principle, with divers modifications suggested by
experience as likely to be more acceptable to the
proprietors or to the crown. And just as the
crown, for purposes of its own and without regard
to the wishes of the people, changed the governments
of Virginia and New Hampshire and extinguished
those of New Haven and Plymouth; so
in nearly every case we find the people becoming
so dissatisfied with the proprietary governments
that one after another they are overturned and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
palatinates become transformed into royal provinces.
We shall, therefore, find it profitable to
trace the history of the palatinate principle in
America through its initial theme and its subsequent
variations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Similarities between Durham and Maryland: the governor.</div>

<p>That initial theme was mainly an echo of the
Old World music, but the differences were not
without importance. In administrative
machinery there was a strong resemblance
between Maryland and Durham.
The governor of Maryland was Lord
Baltimore's chief minister, the head of the civil
administration of the colony. He also presided
over its court of chancery, and in this double
capacity he resembled the chancellor of temporalities.
But, as befitted the head of a community
planted in a hostile wilderness, he added to these
functions those of the lord lieutenant and was
commander-in-chief of the militia. Laws passed
by the assembly required his signature to make
them valid, and thus he possessed the power of
veto; but he could not assent to a law repealing
any law to which the lord proprietor had assented.
Such matters had to be referred to the
lord proprietor, whose prerogatives were jealously
guarded, while the extensive powers accorded to
the governor were such as convenience dictated
in view of the fact that the lord proprietor was
absent in England. An instance of the principle
and its limits is furnished by the governor's pardoning
power, which extended to all offences
except treason.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Secretary: surveyor-general.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Muster master-general: sheriffs.</div>

<p>The personage next in importance to the governor
was the secretary, who as receiver
and disburser of revenues resembled the
receiver-general of Durham, but to
these functions he added those of recorder and
judge of probate, and sometimes also those of
attorney-general. Next came the surveyor-general,
whose functions in determining metes and
bounds and in supervising manorial affairs, resembled
those of the Durham seneschal. Then there
was a lieutenant commander of militia known as
master-general of the muster. In each
county there was a sheriff, who, in addition
to such functions as we are familiar
with, collected all taxes, held all elections, and
made the returns. These four officers&mdash;the secretary,
surveyor-general, muster master-general,
and sheriff&mdash;were paid by fees, the amount of
which was determined by the assembly, which
thus exercised some control over them; but the
governor received a salary from the lord proprietor,
and was to that extent independent of the
legislature.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The courts.</div>

<p>Of courts there was one in each county, but
besides this a considerable number of manors were
created, and each manor had its court baron and
court leet for the transaction of local
business. Small civil cases involving
less than the worth of 1,200 pounds of tobacco,
and criminal cases not involving the death penalty,
were tried in the county courts. Above these was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>the provincial court, which dealt with common
law, chancery, or admiralty, as the case might be.
The judges of this court were all members of the
council, to which the secretary and other chief executive
officers belonged, while the governor presided
alike over the provincial court and over the
council. Appeals could be taken from the provincial
court to the council sitting as the upper
house in the assembly, after the analogy of the
appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords; but
this virtually meant that a case once decided could
be tried over again by the same judges with a few
colleagues added.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The primary assembly.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Initiative in legislation.</div>

<p>The assembly, at the mention of which we have
thus arrived, was the principal point of difference
between the palatinate of Maryland and
that of Durham. The governor of Maryland,
like the bishop of Durham, had his council,
consisting solely, as the other consisted chiefly, of
high officials; but in Maryland there was popular
representation, while in Durham there was not.
At first, however, the popular house was not a
representative but a primary assembly, and its
sittings were not separate from those of the council.
In the first assembly, which met at St.
Mary's in February, 1635, all the freemen, or all
who chose to come, were gathered in the same
room with Leonard Calvert and his council. They
drew up a body of laws and sent it to England for
the lord proprietor's assent, which was refused.
The ground of the refusal was far more than the
mere technicality which on a hasty glance it
might seem to be. Cecilius refused because the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>charter gave the lord proprietor the power of
making laws with the assent of the freemen, but
did not give such power to the freemen with the
assent of the lord proprietor. In other
words, the initiative in legislation must
always come from above, not from below. Obviously
there could be no higher authority than
Cecilius as to what the charter really intended.
But the assembly of Maryland insisted upon the
right of initiating legislation, and Cecilius was
wise enough to yield the point gracefully. He
consented, in view of the length of time required
for crossing the ocean, that laws enacted by the
assembly should at once become operative and
so remain unless vetoed by him. But he reserved
to himself the right of veto without limitation in
time. In other words, he could at any time annul
a law, and this prerogative was one that might
become dangerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The representative assembly.</div>

<p>In 1638 the primary assembly was abandoned
as cumbrous. For purposes of the military levy
the province was divided into hundreds,
and each hundred sent a representative
to the assembly at St. Mary's. At a
later date the county came to be the basis of
representation, as in Virginia. For some time the
representatives sat with the council, as at first
in Massachusetts and Virginia; but in 1650 the
representatives began to sit as a lower house,
while the council formed an upper house. As
there was a tendency, which went on increasing,
for the highest offices to be filled by Calverts and
their kinsmen, the conditions were soon at hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
for an interesting constitutional struggle between
the two houses. It was to be seen whether the
government was to be administered for the Calverts
or for the people, and to the story of this
struggle we shall presently come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Regal power of Lord Baltimore.</div>

<p>As a result of our survey it appears that Lord
Baltimore occupied a far more independent position
than any bishop of Durham. Not
only was he exempt from imperial taxation,
but in case of a controversy between
himself and his subjects no appeal could be
taken to any British court. His power seemed to
approach more nearly to despotism than that of
any king of England, save perhaps Henry VIII.
The one qualifying feature was the representative
assembly, the effects of which time was to show in
unsuspected ways. From various circumstances
mentioned in the course of the present chapter
there resulted a strange series of adventures, which
will next claim our attention.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="c">LEAH AND RACHEL.</p>


<div class="sidenote">William Claiborne and his projects</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already had occasion to observe that,
while from the outset Lord Baltimore's enterprise
found many enemies in England, it was at the
same time regarded with no friendly feelings in
Virginia. We have seen the Virginians
sending to London their secretary of
state, William Claiborne, to obstruct and
thwart the Calverts in their attempt to obtain a
grant of territory in America. For Claiborne there
were interests of his own involved, besides those of
the colony which he represented. This William
Claiborne, younger son of an ancient and honourable
family in Westmoreland, had come to Virginia
in 1621 and prospered greatly, acquiring
large estates and winning the respect and confidence
of his fellow planters. By 1627 he had
begun to engage in trade with the natives along
the shores of Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac
and Susquehanna rivers. Such traffic, if well
managed, was lucrative, since with steel knives
and hatchets, or with ribbons and beads, one could
buy furs which would fetch high prices in England.
To the enterprising Claiborne it seemed worth
while to extend this trade far to the north. His
speculative vision took in the Delaware and Hud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>son
rivers and even included New England and
Nova Scotia. So he entered into an arrangement
with a firm of London merchants, Clobery &amp; Company,
to supply them with furs and other such
eligible commodities as might be obtained from the
Indians, and in 1631 he obtained a royal license
for trading in any and all parts of North America
not already preëmpted by monopolies. This was
done while he was in London opposing Lord Baltimore.
The place most prominently mentioned in
the license was Nova Scotia, and it was obtained
under the seal of Scotland, from the Secretary of
State for Scotland, Sir William Alexander, to
whom Nova Scotia had some time before been
granted. On returning to Virginia, where Sir
John Harvey had lately superseded the convivial
Dr. Pott as governor, Claiborne obtained a further
license to trade with any of the English colonies
and with the Dutch on Henry Hudson's river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kent Island occupied by Claiborne.</div>

<p>Armed with these powers, Claiborne proceeded
to make a settlement upon an island which he had
already, before his visit to London, selected for a
trading post. It was Kent Island, far up
in Chesapeake Bay, almost as far north
as the mouth of the Patapsco River.
Here dwellings were built, and mills for grinding
corn, while gardens were laid out, and orchards
planted, and farms were stocked with cattle.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> A
clergyman was duly appointed, to minister to the
spiritual needs of the little settlement, and in the
next year, 1632, it was represented in the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
of Burgesses by Captain Nicholas Martian, a
patentee of the land where Yorktown now stands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflicting grants.</div>

<p>When in that same year the news of the charter
granted to Lord Baltimore arrived in Virginia, it
was greeted with indignation. No doubt there was
plenty of elbow-room between the old colony and
the land assigned to the new-comers, but the example
of Claiborne shows what far-reaching plans
could be cherished down on James River.
The Virginians had received a princely
territory, and did not like to see it arbitrarily
curtailed. There was no telling where that sort
of thing might end. According to the charter
of 1609, Virginia extended 200 miles northward
from Old Point Comfort,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> or about as far north as
the site of Chester in Pennsylvania; which would
have left no room for Maryland or Delaware. That
charter had indeed been annulled in 1624, but both
James I. and Charles I. had expressly declared that
the annulling of the charter simply abolished the
sovereignty that had been accorded to the Virginia
Company, and did not infringe or diminish the territorial
rights of the colony. Undoubtedly the
grant to the Calverts was one of the numerous
instances in early American history in which the
Stuart kings gave away the same thing to different
parties. Or perhaps we might better say that they
made grants without duly heeding how one might
overlap and encroach upon another. This was
partly the result of carelessness, partly of ignorance
and haziness of mind; flagrant examples of
it were the grants to Robert Gorges in Massachu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>setts
and to Samuel Gorton in Rhode Island. No
serious harm has come of this recklessness, but it
was the cause of much bickering in the early days,
echoes of which may still be heard in silly pouts
and sneers between the grown-up children of divers
neighbour states. As regards the grant to Lord
Baltimore, a protest from Virginia was not only
natural but as inevitable as sunrise. It was discussed
in the Star Chamber in July, 1633, and the
decision was not to disturb Lord Baltimore's charter;
the Virginians might, if they liked, bring suit
against him in the ordinary course of law. From
this decision came many heart-burnings between
Leah and her younger sister Rachel, as a quaint
old pamphleteer calls Virginia and Maryland.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Claiborne's resistance.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Baltimore's instructions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Virginia council supports Claiborne.</div>

<p>Viewed in the light of all the circumstances, it is
difficult to avoid seeing in Claiborne's occupation
of Kent Island a strategic move. Considered as
such, it was bold and not ill-judged. With his
far-reaching schemes the Susquehanna River was
a highway which would enable him to compete with
the Dutch for the northwestern fur trade. By
establishing himself on Kent Island he might command
the approach to that highway. The maxim
that actual possession is nine points in the law was
in his favour. If the Star Chamber had decided
to uphold Virginia's wholesale claim to the territory
granted her in 1609, Claiborne would have
been master of the situation. Even with
the decision as rendered, his own case
was far from hopeless. In the autumn of 1633 he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>petitioned the king to protect his interests and
those of Virginia in Kent Island. He contended
that Baltimore's charter gave jurisdiction only
over territory unsettled and unimproved,&mdash;<i>hactenus
in culta</i>,&mdash;whereas Kent Island had been
settled as a part of Virginia and heavy expenses
incurred there before that charter had been issued.
In sending this petition it was hoped that by resolutely
keeping hold upon the strategic point it
might be possible to make Lord Baltimore reconsider
his plans and take his settlers to some other
region than the shores of Chesapeake Bay. But
this hope was dashed in February, 1634, when
Leonard Calvert with the first party of settlers
arrived in those waters. Claiborne's petition had
not yet been answered, but Lord Baltimore's
instructions to his brother were
conceived in a conciliatory spirit. Leonard
was to see Claiborne and offer him all the aid
in his power toward building up the new settlement
on Kent Island, at the same time reminding him
that the place was in Baltimore's territory and not
a part of Virginia. In other words, Claiborne was
welcome to the property, only he must hold it as a
tenant of the lord proprietor of Maryland, not as
a tenant of the king in Virginia. While the Ark
and the Dove were halting at anchor off Old Point
Comfort, and while Leonard Calvert was ashore
exchanging courtesies with Governor Harvey, he
communicated this message to Claiborne.
At the next meeting of the council,
Claiborne asked his fellow-councillors
what he should do in the matter. In reply they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
wondered that he should ask such a question. Was
not the case perfectly clear? Was there any reason
why they should surrender Kent Island, more
than any other part of Virginia? No, they would
keep it until his Majesty's pleasure should be
known, and meanwhile they would treat the Maryland
company civilly and expected to be so treated
by them. Behind this answer there was much bad
feeling. Not only were the Virginians angry at
the curtailment of their domains, not only were
they alarmed as well as angry at the arrival of
Papists in their neighbourhood, but they were
greatly disgusted because Lord Baltimore's charter
gave him far more extensive trading privileges than
they possessed. Calvert's message to Claiborne
had signified that before trading any further in the
upper parts of Chesapeake Bay he must obtain a
license from Maryland. Assured now of support
from Virginia, Claiborne returned an answer in
which he refused in any way to admit Lord Baltimore's
sovereignty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complications with the Indians.</div>

<p>Leonard's instructions had been in case of such
a refusal not to molest Claiborne for at least a
year. But soon complications arose. The settlers
at St. Mary's observed indications of
distrust or hostility on the part of a
neighbouring Algonquin tribe, known as
the Patuxents; so they appealed to one Captain
Henry Fleete, who understood the Algonquin
language, to learn what was the matter. This
Captain Fleete wished to supplant Claiborne in
the fur trade and may have welcomed a chance
of discrediting him with the Marylanders. At all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
events, he reported that the Indians had been told
that the Marylanders were not Englishmen but
Spaniards, and for this calumny, which might have
led to the massacre of the new-comers, he undertook
to throw the blame upon Claiborne. In the
substance of this story there is a strong appearance
of truth. On the Virginia coast in those days
common parlance was not nice as to discriminating
between Papists of any kind and Spaniards, and
one can easily see how from ordinary gossip the
Indians may have got their notion. There is no
reason for casting atrocious imputations upon Claiborne,
who was examined in June, 1634, by a joint
commission of Virginians and Marylanders, and
completely exonerated. But before the news of
this verdict reached London, the charge that Claiborne
was intriguing with the Indians had been
carried to Lord Baltimore and evidently alarmed
him. Convinced that forbearance had ceased to
be a virtue, he sent word to his brother to seize
Kent Island, arrest Claiborne, and hold him prisoner
until further instructions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reprisals and skirmishes.</div>

<p>This was in September, 1634. News of the
message came to the ears of Claiborne's London
partners, Clobery &amp; Company, and they petitioned
the king for protection in the possession of their
island. Charles accordingly instructed Lord Baltimore
not to molest Claiborne and his people,
and he sent a letter to the governor and council of
Virginia, in which he declared that the
true intention or the charter which he
had granted to Baltimore would not justify
that nobleman in any interference with Kent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Island and its settlers. So the winter wore away
without incident, but early in April, 1635, one of
Claiborne's ships, commanded by one Thomas
Smith, was seized in the Patuxent River by Captain
Fleete; she was condemned for trading without
a license, and was confiscated and sold with
all her cargo. Claiborne then sent out an armed
sloop, the Cockatrice, to make reprisals upon
Maryland shipping; but Calvert was wide awake
and sent Cornwallis with a stronger force of two
armed pinnaces, which overtook the Cockatrice in
Pocomoke River and captured her after a brisk
skirmish in which half a dozen men were killed
and more wounded. That was on April 23, and
on May 10 there was another fight in the harbour
of Great Wighcocomoco, at the mouth of the
Pocomoke, in which Thomas Smith commanded
for Claiborne and defeated the Marylanders with
more bloodshed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complaints against Governor Harvey.</div>

<p>In the midst of these unseemly quarrels the
kingdom of Virginia witnessed something like a
revolution. We have already had occasion to mention
Sir John Harvey, the governor who came
in March, 1630, after the brief administration of
that versatile practitioner, Dr. John Pott. Harvey
was not long in getting into trouble.
It was noticed at first that his manners
were intolerably rude. He strutted about
Jamestown as if he were on a quarter deck, and
treated the august members of the council with
as little ceremony as if they had been boot-blacks.
On his own confession he once assaulted a councillor
and knocked out some of his teeth "with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
cudgel."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> But it presently appeared that arrogance
was not his worst fault. He was too fond
of money, and not particular as to how it came to
him. He had a right to make grants of land to
settlers for a consideration to be paid into the
public treasury; it was charged against him that
part of the consideration found its way into his
own pockets. Nor was this all, for it happened,
after the fashion of his royal master, that some of
the lands which he granted were already private
property. Besides this, he seems to have undertaken
to draw up laws and proclaim them of his
own authority without submitting them to the assembly;
he refused to render an account of the
ways in which he spent the public money; he had
excessive fees charged, multiplied the number of
fines beyond all reason, and took the proceeds or
a part of them for his private use and behoof.
In short, he seems to have been a second and
more vulgar Argall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rage of Virginians against Maryland.</div>

<p>Five years of this sort of thing had driven the
men of Virginia to the last pitch of desperation,
when the Claiborne imbroglio brought on a crisis.
In obedience to the king's instructions, Harvey
showed such favour as he could to the Maryland
settlers, and thus made himself the more fiercely
hated in Virginia. The Kent Island question was
one that bred dissension in families, separated
bosom friends, and sowed seeds
of distrust and suspicion far and wide.
To speak well of Maryland was accounted little
less than a crime. "Sell cattle to Maryland!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
exclaimed the wrathful planters, "better knock
them on the head!" From pious people this near
approach of the Scarlet Woman drew forth strong
words. We are told that one day Captain Samuel
Mathews, that brave gentleman and decorous Puritan,
on reading a letter from England, dashed his
hat upon the ground and stamped in fury, shouting
"A pox upon Maryland!"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">An angry parson.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The meeting at Warren's house.</div>

<p>In such a state of things we can imagine what a
storm was raised when Governor Harvey removed
from office the able and popular secretary of state,
William Claiborne, and appointed one Richard
Kemp in his place. One lively gleam of vituperation
lights up the grave pages of the colonial records,
when Kev. Anthony Panton called
Mr. Kemp a "jackanapes," and told him
that he was "unfit for the place of secretary," and
that "his hair-lock was tied up with ribbon as
old as St. Paul's." We shall hereafter see how
the outraged secretary nursed his wrath; what he
might have done in its freshness was prevented
by a sudden revolution. The assembly drew up
a protest against the king's attempts at monopolizing
the tobacco trade, and Harvey refused to
transmit the protest to England. About the same
time the news arrived of the seizing of Claiborne's
ship in Maryland waters. On the petition of
many of the people, a meeting of the assembly
was called for May 7, to receive complaints against
Sir John Harvey.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In the mean time, on April
27, an indignation meeting was held at the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>of William Warren, in York, where the principal
speakers were Nicholas Martian, formerly
member of the House of Burgesses
for Kent Island, Francis Pott, the doctor's
brother, and William English, sheriff of
York County. The house where this meeting was
held in 1635 seems to have stood on or near the
site of the house afterward owned by Augustine
Moore, where in 1781 the surrender of Lord Cornwallis
was arranged; and by a curious coincidence
the speaker Nicholas Martian was a direct ancestor
both of George Washington, who commanded
the army of the United States, and of Thomas
Nelson, who commanded the forces of Virginia, on
that memorable occasion.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Scene in the council.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Harvey deposed.</div>

<p>Next morning Martian, Pott, and English were
arrested, and when they asked the reason why,
Governor Harvey politely told them that they
"should know at the gallows." When the council
met, the wrathful governor strode up and down
the room, demanding that the prisoners be instantly
put to death by martial law, but
the council insisted that no harm should
come to them without a regular trial. Then Harvey
with a baleful frown put the question after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
manner of Richard III., "What do they deserve
that have gone about to dissuade the people from
their obedience to his Majesty's substitute?" A
young member, George Menefie, replied with
adroit sarcasm that he was too young a lawyer to
be ready with "a suddain opinion" upon such a
question. Turning savagely upon him, Sir John
asked what all the fuss was about. "Because
of the detaining of the assembly's protest," said
Menefie. Then the governor struck Menefie heavily
upon the shoulder and exclaimed, "I arrest
you on suspicion of treason," whereupon Captain
John Utie, roughly seizing the governor, answered,
"And we the like to you, sir!" Samuel Mathews
threw his arms about Harvey and forced him down
into a chair, while that connoisseur in beverages,
Dr. Pott, waved his hand at the window, and in
the twinkling of an eye the house was surrounded
by armed men. Mathews then told the helpless
governor that he must go to London to answer
charges that would be brought against him. In
vain did Harvey argue and storm. The sequel
may best be told in the words of the terse and
bleak entry in the colonial records: "On
the 28th of April, 1635, Sir John Harvey
thrust out of his government; and Capt. John
West acts as governor till the king's pleasure
known." When the assembly met on May 7,
these proceedings of the council were approved,
and commissioners were appointed to go to London
and lay their complaints before the king.
The indignant Harvey went by the same ship, in
the custody of his quondam prisoner, Francis Pott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
whom he had been so anxious to hang without
ceremony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harvey's return.</div>

<p>Such were the incidents of the ever memorable
"thrusting out of Sir John Harvey," the first
revolutionary scene that was acted in English
America. When King Charles heard the story
he did not feel quite so much fondness for his
trusty and well-beloved burgesses as when he had
been seeking commercial favours from them. He
would not receive their commissioners or hear a
word on their side of the case, and he swore that
Sir John Harvey should straightway go
back to Virginia as governor, even were
it only for one day. But when it came to acting,
Charles was not quite so bold as his words.
Harvey did not return until nearly two years had
elapsed.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Then it was the turn of the rebellious
councillors&mdash;Utie, Mathews, West, Menefie, and
Dr. Pott&mdash;to go to London and defend themselves,
while Harvey wreaked mean-spirited vengeances
on his enemies. The day of reckoning had
come for Anthony Panton, the minister who had
called Mr. Secretary Kemp a "jackanapes," and
had, moreover, as it seemed, spoken irreverently of
Archbishop Laud. Panton's conduct was judged
to be "mutinous, rebellious, and riotous,"<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> his
estate was confiscated, and he was banished. A
shameful clause was inserted in the sentence, declaring
him outlawed if he should venture to
return to Virginia, and authorizing anybody to
kill him at sight; but Harvey afterward tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
to disown this clause, saying that it had been
wickedly interpolated by the vindictive Kemp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harvey's fall and death.</div>

<p>But Harvey's new lease of power was brief.
Enemies to the throne were getting too numerous
for comfort, and we may well believe that Charles,
having once vindicated his royal dignity in the
matter, was quite ready to yield. The statements
of the councillors under examination in London
no doubt had weight, for no proceedings were
taken against them, but in 1639 the king
removed Harvey, and sent the excellent
Sir Francis Wyatt once more to govern Virginia.
Harvey's numerous victims forthwith overwhelmed
him with law-suits, his ill-gotten wealth was
quickly disgorged, his estates were sold to indemnify
Panton and others, and the fallen tyrant,
bankrupt and friendless, soon sank into the grave,&mdash;such
an instance of poetic justice as is seldom
realized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evelin sent to Kent Island.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Kent Island seized by Calvert.</div>

<p>It was in December, 1637, during Harvey's
second administration, that the Kent Island troubles
were renewed. After Claiborne's victorious
fight at Great Wighcocomoco, in May, 1635, he
retained undisturbed possession of the island, but
a quarrel was now brewing between himself and his
London partners, Clobery &amp; Company. They were
dissatisfied because furs did not come in
quantities sufficient to repay their advances
to Claiborne. The disputes with
the Marylanders had sadly damaged the business,
and the partners sent over George Evelin to look
after their interests, and armed him with power of
attorney. They requested Claiborne to turn over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>to him the island, with everything on it, and to
come to London and settle accounts. Claiborne
tried to get a bond from Evelin not to surrender
the island to Calvert, but that agent refused to
give any assurances, except to express in strong
language his belief that Calvert had no just claim
to it. Nothing was left for Claiborne but to leave
Evelin in possession. He did so under protest, and
in May, 1637, sailed for England, where Clobery
&amp; Company immediately brought suit against
him. Evelin then went to Virginia and attached
all of Claiborne's property that he could find.
Presently, whether from policy or from conviction,
he changed his views as to the ownership of Kent
Island and invited Leonard Calvert to come and
take it. After some hesitation, in December, 1637,
Calvert occupied the premises with forty or fifty
armed men and appointed Evelin commandant of
the island. Forthwith so many people
were arrested for debts owed to Clobery
&amp; Company that an insurrection ensued,
and in February, 1638, Calvert had to come over
again and enforce his authority. Among his prisoners
taken in December was Thomas Smith, the
victor in the fight at Great Wighcocomoco, who
was now tried for piracy and hanged, while the
Maryland assembly passed a bill of attainder
against Claiborne, and all his accessible property
was seized for the benefit of Lord Baltimore's
treasury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decision is given against Claiborne.</div>

<p>Soon afterward the final and crushing blow was
dealt in London. A Board of Commissioners for
the Plantations had lately been created there, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>germ that in later years was to develop into the
well-known body commonly called the Lords of
Trade. To this board the dispute over
Kent Island had been referred, and the
decision was rendered in April, 1638. In
the decision the claims of Virginia were ignored,
and the matter was treated like a personal dispute
between Claiborne and Lord Baltimore. The latter
had a grant of sovereignty under the seal of
England, the former had merely a trading license
under the seal of Scotland, and this could not be
pleaded in bar of the greater claim. Kent Island
was thus adjudged to Lord Baltimore. Crestfallen
but not yet conquered, the sturdy Claiborne returned
to Virginia to await the turn of Fortune's
wheel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Puritans in Virginia.</div>

<p>In curious ways the march of events was tending
in Claiborne's favour. At first sight there is
no obvious connection between questions of religion
and the ownership of a small wooded island,
but it would be difficult to name any kind of quarrel
to which the Evil One has not contrived to
give a religious colouring. By the year
1638 the population of Virginia had come
to contain more than 1,000 Puritans, or about
seven per cent. of the whole. They had begun
coming to Virginia in 1611 with Sir Thomas
Dale, whose friend, the Rev. Alexander Whitaker,
the famous "Apostle of Virginia," was a staunch
Puritan, son of an eminent Puritan divine who
was Master of St. John's College, Cambridge.
The general reader, who thinks of Whitaker correctly
as a minister of the Church of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
must not forget that in 1611 the Puritans had not
separated from the Established Church, but were
striving to reform it from within. As yet there
were few Separatists, save the Pilgrims who had
fled to Holland three years before. The first considerable
separation of Puritans occurred when the
colony of Massachusetts Bay was founded in 1629.
The great gulf between Puritans and Churchmen
was dug by the Civil War, and the earliest date
when it becomes strictly proper to speak of "Dissenters"
is 1662, when the first parliament of
Charles II. passed the Act of Uniformity. In the
earliest days of Virginia, Puritan Churchmen were
common there. When in 1617 the good Whitaker
was drowned in James River, he was succeeded by
George Keith, who was also a Puritan.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Under
the administration of Sandys and Southampton
many came. Their chief settlements were south
of James River, at first in Isle of Wight County
and afterwards in Nansemond. Among their principal
leaders were Richard Bennett, son of a
wealthy London merchant and afterwards governor
of Virginia, and Daniel Gookin, noted for
his bravery in the Indian massacre of 1622.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Act of Uniformity, 1631.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Puritan ministers from New England.</div>

<div class="sidenote">New Act of Uniformity, 1643.</div>

<p>An act of the assembly in 1631 prescribed "that
there be a uniformity throughout this colony both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>in substance and circumstances to the canons and
constitution of the Church of England."
This legislation probably reveals the
hand of William Laud, who had three
years before become bishop of London; and it
may be taken to indicate that a large majority of
Virginians had come to disapprove of Puritanism.
Probably the act was not vigorously enforced, for
Governor Harvey seems to have looked with favour
upon Puritans, but it may have caused some
of their pastors to quit the colony. In 1641 an
appeal for more ministers was sent to Boston, and
in response three clergymen&mdash;William Thompson
of Braintree, John Knowles of Watertown, and
Thomas James of New Haven&mdash;sailed
from Narragansett Bay in December,
1642. Their little ship was wrecked at
Hell Gate and their welcome from the Dutch at
Manhattan was but surly; nevertheless they were
able to procure a new ship, and so, after a wintry
voyage of eleven weeks, arrived in James River.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
They brought excellent letters of recommendation
from Governor Winthrop to the governor of Virginia,
but might as well have thrown them into the
fire, for the new governor of Virginia, who arrived
in 1642, was the famous Sir William Berkeley, a
Cavalier of Cavaliers, a firm believer in the methods
of Strafford and Laud, an implacable foe of
Puritanism and all its advocates. At the next
meeting of the assembly, in March, 1643, the following
act was passed: "For the preservation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>the purity of doctrine and unity of the Church, it
is enacted that all ministers whatsoever,
which shall reside in the colony, are to
be conformed to the orders and constitution
of the Church of England, and not otherwise
to be admitted to teach or preach publicly or privately,
and that the Governor and Council do take
care that all non-conformists, upon notice of them,
shall be compelled to depart the colony with all
convenience."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Expulsion of the ministers.</div>

<p>Armed with this fulmination, Berkeley was not
long in getting rid of the parsons whom Winthrop
had commended to his hospitality. Knowles and
James went in April, after some weeks
of incessant and successful preaching
but Thompson, "a man of tall and
comely presence" as we are told, stayed through
the summer and made many converts, among them
the wayward son of Daniel Gookin, a junior Daniel
whose conversion was from worldliness or perhaps
devilry rather than from prelacy. This
brand snatched from the burning by Thompson
went to Massachusetts, where for many years he
was superintendent of Indian affairs and won
fame by his character and writings. Thompson's
work in Virginia is thus commemorated by Cotton
Mather:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian massacre of 1644.</div>

<p>The expulsion of the Boston ministers was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>beginning of a systematic harassing of the Puritans
in Virginia. It was strangely affected by the
massacre perpetrated by the Indians in the spring
of 1644.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> We seem carried back to the
times of John Smith when we encounter
once more the grim figure of Opekankano
alive and on the war-path. We have no
need, however, with some thoughtless writers, to
call him a hundred years old. It was only thirty-six
years since Smith's capture by the Indians,
although so much history had been made that the
interval seems much longer. Though a wrinkled
and grizzled warrior, Opekankano need not have
been more than sixty or seventy when he wreaked
upon the white men his second massacre, on the
eve of Good Friday, 1644. The victims numbered
about 300, but the Indians were quickly put down
by Berkeley, and a new treaty confined them to the
north of York River; any Indian venturing across
that boundary, except as an envoy duly marked
with a badge, was liable to be shot at sight. Opekankano
was taken captive and carried on a litter
to Jamestown, whence Berkeley intended to send
him to London as a trophy and spectacle, but
before sailing time the old chief was ignobly murdered
by one of his guards. It was the end of the
Powhatan confederacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflicting views of theodicy.</div>

<p>Some worthy people interpreted this massacre
as a judgment of Heaven upon the kingdom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>Virginia for the sin of harbouring Puritans; rather
a tardy judgment, one would say, coming a year
after the persecution of such heretics
had begun in earnest. In Governor
Winthrop's opinion,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> on the contrary,
the sin which received such grewsome punishment
was the expulsion of the Boston ministers, with
other acts of persecution that followed. Rev.
Thomas Harrison, the bigoted Berkeley's bigoted
chaplain, saw the finger of God in the massacre,
repented of his own share in the work of persecution,
and upbraided the governor, who forthwith
dismissed him. Then Harrison turned Puritan
and went to preaching at Nansemond, in flat defiance
of Berkeley, who ordered and threatened and
swore till he was out of breath, when suddenly
business called him over to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Invasion of Maryland by Claiborne and Ingle.</div>

<p>It was the year of Marston Moor, an inauspicious
year for Cavaliers, but a hopeful time for
that patient waiter, William Claiborne. The governor
of Maryland, as well as the governor of Virginia,
had gone to England on business, and while
the cats were away the mice did play. The king
ordered that any Parliament ships that might be
tarrying in Maryland waters should
forthwith be seized. When this order
was received at St. Mary's, the deputy-governor,
Giles Brent, felt bound to obey it, and
as there seemed to be no ships accessible that had
been commissioned by Parliament, he seized the
ship of one Richard Ingle, a tobacco trader who
was known to be a Puritan and strongly suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
of being a pirate. This incident caused some excitement
and afforded the watchful Claiborne his
opportunity of revenge. He made visits to Kent
Island and tried to dispel the doubts of the inhabitants
by assuring them that he had a commission
from the king.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> He may have meant by this some
paper given him by Charles I. before the adverse
decision of 1638 and held as still valid by some
private logic of his own. When Governor Calvert
returned from England in the autumn of 1644
he learned that Claiborne was preparing to invade
his dominions, along with Ingle, who had brought
upon the scene another ship well manned and
heavily armed. It was a curious alliance, inasmuch
as Claiborne had professed to be acting with
a royal commission, while Ingle now boasted of a
commission from Parliament. But this trifling
flaw in point of consistency did not make the alliance
a weak one. It is not sure that the invasion
was concerted between Claiborne and Ingle, though
doubtless the former welcomed the aid of the latter
in reinstating himself in what he believed to
be his right. The invasion was completely successful.
While Claiborne recovered Kent Island,
Ingle captured St. Mary's, and Leonard Calvert
was fain to take refuge in Virginia. During two
years of anarchy Ingle and his men roamed about
"impressing" corn and tobacco, cattle and household
furniture, stuffing ships with plunder to be
exported and turned into hard cash. The estates
of Cornwallis were especially ill-treated, the Indian
mission was broken up, and good Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
White, loaded with irons, was sent to England on
a trumped-up charge of treason, of which he was
promptly acquitted. Long afterward this Claiborne-Ingle
frolic was remembered in Maryland
as the "plundering time."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expulsion of Claiborne and Ingle.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment of William Stone as governor.</div>

<p>In 1645 Sir William Berkeley returned to Virginia,
and from him the fugitive Calvert received
effective aid and sympathy, so that late in 1646 he
was able to invade his own territory with a force
of Virginians and fugitive Marylanders.
Claiborne and Ingle were soon expelled,
and Leonard Calvert's authority was fully
reëstablished. Not long afterward, in June, 1647,
this able governor died. For his brother Cecilius,
Lord Baltimore, this was a trying time. He was a
royalist at heart, with little sympathy for Puritans,
but like many other Catholics he thought it wise
to keep on good terms with Parliament, in the hope
of securing more toleration than heretofore. Such
a course between Charybdis and Scylla was attended
with perils. In 1648 Cecilius
appointed to his governorship William
Stone, a liberal-minded Protestant and
supporter of Parliament. Soon after the king's
beheading, the young Charles II., a fugitive in the
island of Jersey, hearing of Stone's appointment,
interpreted it as an act of disloyalty on Baltimore's
part, and so in a fit of spite made out a grant handing
over the palatinate of Maryland to Sir William
Davenant, that poet-laureate who was said to
resemble Shakespeare until ravening vanity made
him pretend to be Shakespeare's illegitimate son.
Sir William actually set sail for America, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
overhauled in the Channel by a Parliament cruiser
and carried off to the Tower, where amid sore distress
he found a generous protector in John Milton.
It was not very long before Charles II. came to
realize his mistake about Lord Baltimore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Toleration Act of 1649.</div>

<p>In Maryland the great event of the year 1649,
which witnessed the death of Charles I., was the
passage on April 21 of the Act concerning Religion.
This famous statute, commonly
known as the "Toleration Act, was
drawn up by Cecilius himself, and passed
the assembly exactly as it came from him, without
amendment. With regard to Cecilius, therefore,
it may be held to show, if not the ideas which he
actually entertained, at least those which he deemed
it prudent to embody in legislation. It is not
likely to have surpassed his ideals, but it may
easily have fallen somewhat short of them. The
statute is so important that the pertinent sections
of it deserve to be quoted at length:<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>&mdash;</p>

professing to believe in Jesus Christ, shall
from henceforth bee any waies troubled, molested
or discountenanced for or in respect to his or her
religion."</p>

<p>A statute which threatens Unitarians with death
leaves something to be desired in the way of toleration,
even though it fines a man ten shillings for
calling his neighbour a Calvinist in a reproachful
manner. Nevertheless, for the age when it was
enacted this statute was eminently liberal, and it
certainly reflects great credit upon Lord Baltimore.
To be ruler over a country wherein no person professing
to believe in Jesus Christ should be molested
in the name of religion was a worthy ambition,
and one from which Baltimore's contemporaries in
Massachusetts and elsewhere might have learned
valuable lessons. Such a policy as was announced
in this memorable Toleration Act was not easy to
realize in the seventeenth century. The very year
in which it was enacted saw the grim wolf of intolerance
thrusting his paw in at the door.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Migration of Puritans from Virginia to Maryland.</div>

<p>As had happened before, the woes of the Virginia
Leah brought woe upon the Maryland Rachel.
When Governor Berkeley returned from
England, he did more than swear at the defiant
chaplain Harrison and the other preachers of Puritanism
south of James River. He banished the
pastors and made life unendurable for the flocks.
In 1648 two of the Nansemond elders, Richard
Bennett and William Durand, fleeing to Maryland,
were kindly received by Governor Stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>who extended a most hospitable invitation to their
people to leave Virginia and settle in the
Baltimore palatinate. Cecilius had complained
that settlers did not come fast
enough and his colony was still too weak,
whereupon Stone had promised to do his best to
bring in 500 new people. His opportunity had
now come; early in 1649 an advance body of 300
Puritans came from Nansemond. The rest of their
brethren hesitated, fearing lest Catholics might be
no pleasanter neighbours than the king's men, but
the course of events soon decided them. The news
of the execution of Charles I. was generally greeted
in Virginia with indignation and horror, feelings
which were greatly intensified by the arrival of
the Cavaliers who in that year began to flock to
Virginia. One ship in September brought 330
Cavaliers, and probably more than 1,000 came in
the course of the year. In October the assembly
declared that the beheading of the king was an
act of treason which nobody in Virginia must dare
to speak in defence of under penalty of death. It
also spoke of the fugitive Charles II. as "his Majesty
that now is," and made it treason to call his
authority in question. These were the last straws
upon the back of the Puritan camel, and in the
course of the next few months the emigration from
Nansemond went on till as many as 1,000 persons
had gone over to Maryland. They settled upon
land belonging to the Susquehannocks, near the
mouth of a stream upon which they bestowed the
name of the glorious English river that falls into
the sea between Glamorgan and the Mendip Hills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
and the county through which this new-found
Severn flowed they called Providence from feelings
like those which had led Roger Williams to
give that comforting name to his settlement on
Narragansett Bay. Presently this new Providence
became a county bearing Lady Baltimore's name,
Anne Arundel, and the city which afterwards grew
up in it was called Annapolis. This country had
not been cleared for agriculture by the Indians,
like the region about St. Mary's, and there was
some arduous pioneer work for the Puritan colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Designs of the Puritans.</div>

<p>In changing the settlement or plantation of Providence
into the county of Anne Arundel, something
more than a question of naming was involved.
The affair was full of political significance.
Puritans at first entertained an idea that
they might be allowed to form an <i>imperium
in imperio</i>, maintaining a kind of
Greek autonomy on the banks of their Severn,
instead of becoming an integral portion of Baltimore's
palatinate. At first they refused to elect
representatives to the assembly at St. Mary's;
when presently they yielded to Governor Stone's
urgency and sent two representatives in 1650, one
of them was straightway chosen speaker of the
House; nevertheless, in the next year the Puritans
again held aloof. They believed that the Puritan
government in England would revoke Lord Baltimore's
charter, and they wished to remain separated
from his fortunes. Their willingness to settle
within his territory was coupled with the belief
that it would not much longer be his.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Submission of Virginia to Cromwell.</div>

<p>This belief was not wholly without reason. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>war-ships of the Commonwealth were about to
appear in Chesapeake Bay. Such audacious proceedings
as those of the Virginia Assembly could
not be allowed to go unnoticed by Parliament, and
early in 1652 four commissioners were sent to
receive the submission of Berkeley and his colony.
One of these commissioners was Richard Bennett,
the Puritan elder who had been driven from Nansemond.
Another was the irrepressible Claiborne,
whom Berkeley had helped drive out of Maryland.
The Virginians at first intended to defy the commissioners
and resist the fleet, but after some parley
leading to negotiations, they changed their
minds. It was not prudent to try to stand up
against Oliver Cromwell, and he, for his
part, was no fanatic. Virginia must
submit, but she might call it a voluntary
submission. She might keep her assembly, by
which alone could she be taxed, all prohibitions
upon her trade should be repealed, and her people
might toast the late king in private as much as
they pleased; only no public stand against the
Commonwealth would be tolerated. On these
terms Virginia submitted. Sir William Berkeley
resigned the governorship, sold his brick house in
Jamestown, and went out to his noble plantation
at Green Spring near by, there to bide his time.
For the next eight years things moved along peaceably
under three successive Roundhead governors,
all chosen by the House of Burgesses. The first
was Richard Bennett, who was succeeded in March,
1655, by Edward Digges; and after a year Digges
was followed by that gallant Samuel Mathews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
who had once given such a bear's hug to the arrogant
Sir John Harvey. As for Claiborne, he was
restored to his old office of secretary of state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Claiborne and Bennett in Maryland.</div>

<p>In Maryland there was more trouble. As soon
as Claiborne had disposed of the elder sister,
Leah, he went to settle accounts with the youthful
Rachel, who had so many wooers. There
was Episcopal Virginia, whose pretensions
to the fair damsel were based on its
old charter; there was the Catholic lord proprietor,
to whom Charles I. had solemnly betrothed
her; there were the Congregational brethren of
Providence on the Severn, whose new pretensions
made light of these earlier vows; but the master of
the situation was Claiborne, with his commission
from Parliament and his heavily armed frigate.
Mighty little cared he, says a contemporary writer,
for religion or for punctilios; what he was after
was that sweet and rich country. Claiborne's conduct,
however, did not quite merit such a slur. In
this his hour of triumph he behaved without violence,
nor do we find him again laying hands upon
Kent Island. On arriving with Bennett at St.
Mary's, they demanded that Governor Stone and
his council should sign a covenant "to be true
and faithful to the Commonwealth of England as
it is now established without King or House of
Lords." To this demand no objection was made,
but the further demand, that all writs and warrants
should run no longer in Baltimore's name, but in
the name of the Keepers of the Liberty of England,
was obstinately refused. For this refusal
Stone was removed from office, a provisional gov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>ernment
was established, and the commissioners
sailed away. This was in April, 1652. After two
months of meditation Stone sent word to Jamestown
that he was willing to yield in the matter
of the writs, whereupon Claiborne and Bennett
promptly returned to St. Mary's and restored him
to office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewal of the troubles.</div>

<p>But those were shifting times. Within a year,
in April, 1653, Cromwell turned out of doors the
Rump Parliament, otherwise called Keepers of the
Liberty of England; and accordingly, as writs
could no longer run in their name, Stone announced
that he should issue them, as formerly, in
the name of Lord Baltimore. He did this by
order of Cecilius himself. Trouble arose
at the same time between Stone and the
Puritans of Providence, and the result of all this
was the reappearance of Bennett and Claiborne at
St. Mary's, in July, 1654. Again they deposed
Stone and placed the government in the hands of
a council, with William Fuller as its president.
Then they issued writs for the election of an assembly,
and once more departed for Jamestown.
According to the tenor of these writs, no Roman
Catholic could either be elected as a burgess or
vote at the election; in this way a house was obtained
that was almost unanimously Puritan, and
in October this novel assembly so far forgot its
sense of the ludicrous as to pass a new "Toleration
Act" securing to all persons freedom of conscience,
provided such liberty were not extended
to "popery, prelacy, or licentiousness of opinion."
In short, these liberal Puritans were ready to tol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>erate
everybody except Catholics, Episcopalians,
and anybody else who disagreed with them!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of the Severn.</div>

<p>When Lord Baltimore heard how Stone had
surrendered the government, he wrote a letter
chiding him for it. The legal authority of the
commissioners, Bennett and Claiborne, had expired
with the Rump Parliament. Cromwell was
now Lord Protector, and according to his own
theory the Protectorate was virtually the assignee
of the Crown and successor to all its rights and
obligations. Baltimore's charter was therefore as
sound under the Protectorate as it had ever been.
Knowing that Cromwell favoured this view, Cecilius
wrote to Stone to resume the government and
withstand the Puritans. This led at once to civil
war. Governor Stone gathered a force of 130
men and marched against the settlement
at Providence, flying Baltimore's beautiful
flag of black and gold. Captain Fuller, with
175 men, was ready for him, and the two little
armies met on the bank of the Severn, March 25,
1655. Besides his superiority in numbers, Fuller
was helped by two armed merchant ships, the one
British, the other from New England, which kept
up a sharp fire from the river. Stone's men were
put to flight, leaving one third of their number in
killed and wounded. One old Puritan writer tells
us with keen enjoyment that the field whence they
fled was strewn with their "Papist beads." Among
the prisoners taken was Stone himself, who was
badly wounded. Fuller at once held a court-martial
at which Stone and nine other leading
men were sentenced to death. Four were executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
but on the intercession of some kind-hearted women
Stone and the others were pardoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Baltimore sustained by Cromwell.</div>

<p>The supremacy of the Puritans in Maryland
thus seemed to be established, but it was of short
duration. Some of the leading Puritans in Virginia,
such as Bennett and Mathews, visited London
and tried to get Baltimore's charter annulled.
But their efforts soon revealed the fact
that Cromwell was not on their side of
the question, and so they gave up in despair,
and the quarrel of nearly thirty years' standing
was at last settled by a compromise in 1657.
Lord Baltimore promised complete amnesty for
all offences against his government from the very
beginning, and he gave his word never to consent
to the repeal of his Toleration Act of 1649. Upon
these terms Virginia withdrew her opposition to
his charter, and indemnified Claiborne by extensive
land grants for the loss of Kent Island. Baltimore
appointed Captain Josias Fendall to be governor
of Maryland and sent out his brother Philip
Calvert to be secretary. The men of Providence
were fain to accept toleration at the hands of those
to whom they had refused to grant it, and in
March, 1658, Governor Fendall's authority was
acknowledged throughout the palatinate. Peace
reigned on the shores of Chesapeake Bay, the
claims of Leah and Rachel were adjusted, and the
fair sisters quarrelled no more.</p>

"Your sheep, that were wont to be so meek and tame, are now
become so great devourers and so wild that they eat up and swallow
down the very men themselves. They consume, destroy, and
devour whole fields, houses, and cities; for look in what part of
the realm doth grow the finest, and therefore dearest wool, there
noblemen and gentlemen, yea, and certain abbots, holy men, God
wot! not contenting themselves with the yearly revenues and
profits that were wont to grow to their forefathers and predecessors
of their lands, nor being content that they live in rest and
pleasure&mdash;nothing profiting, yea, much annoying the weal publick&mdash;leave
no ground for tillage; they enclose all into pastures,
they throw down houses, they pluck down towns, and
leave nothing standing but only the church to be made a sheep-house.
And, as though you lost no small quantity of ground by
forests, chases, lands, and parks, those good holy men turn all
dwelling places and all glebe lands into desolation and wilderness,
enclosing many thousands acres of ground together within
one pale or hedge," while those who formerly lived on the land,
"poor, silly, wretched souls, men, women, husbands, wives,
fatherless children, widows, and woeful mothers with young
babes, were starving and homeless. And where many labourers
had existed by field labour, only a single shepherd or herdsman
was occupied."&mdash;<i>Utopia</i>, book i.</p></div>

through females only, and when the English visitors were told
that The Powhatan's office would descend to his maternal
brothers, even though he had sons living, the information was
evidently correct, but they found it hard to understand or believe.
So when one of the chiefs on the James River insisted
upon giving back some powder and balls which one of his men
had stolen, it was regarded as a proof of strict honesty and
friendliness, whereas the more probable explanation is that a
prudent Indian, at that early time, would consider it bad medicine

"General History" in 1624 (see Smith's <i>Works</i>, p. 530); so that
Smith's detractors may urge that the letter is trumped up and
was never sent to Queen Anne. If so, the question recurs, Why
did not some enemy or hostile critic of Smith in 1624 call attention
to so flagrant a fraud?</p></div>

with white men and inclined to dread them as more or less supernatural;
but they had thoroughly learned that fair skins and
long beards were no safeguard against disease and death. If
they did not know that the Jamestown colony had dwindled
to eight-and-thirty men, they knew that their own warriors had
slain all Smith's party and taken him captive.</p></div>

the most important are those of Charles Deane, in his <i>Notes on
Wingfield's Discourse of Virginia</i>, Boston, 1859, and Henry
Adams, in the <i>North American Review</i>, vol. civ. Their arguments
have been ably answered by W. W. Henry, in <i>Proceedings
of Virginia Historical Society</i>, 1882, and Charles Poindexter, in
his <i>Captain John Smith and his Critics</i>, Richmond, 1893. There
are two writers of valuable books who seldom allude to Smith
without sneers and words of abuse,&mdash;Alexander Brown, of Virginia,
and Edward Duffield Neill, of Minnesota; they seem to resent,
as a personal grievance, the fact that the gallant captain
ever existed. On the other hand, no one loves him better than
the learned editor of his books, who has studied them with microscopic
thoroughness, Edward Arber. My own defence of Smith,
when set forth in a lecture at University College, London, 1879,
was warmly approved by my friend, the late Henry Stevens.</p></div>

A lad, Henry Spelman, son of the famous antiquary. Sir
Henry Spelman, was at the Pamunkey village when Ratcliffe and
his party were massacred by The Powhatan (see above, p. 153).
The young man's life was saved by Pocahontas, and he was
probably adopted. Argall found him with Pocahontas among
the Potomacs, and bought him at the cost of a small further outlay
in copper. Spelman afterward became a person of some importance
in the colony. His "Relation of Virginia," containing
an interesting account of the Ratcliffe massacre and other matters,
was first published under the learned editorship of Henry
Stevens in 1872, and has since been reprinted in Arber's invaluable
edition of Smith's <i>Works</i>, pp. ci.-cxiv.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
